Maps are the basic tools geographers use to present information. Computers have revolutionized mapmaking and placed geography on the forefront of research. Many employers are looking for people trained in high-tech sub-fields such as computer assisted cartography, remote sensing and GIS. Environmental problems have become the concern of government officials and citizens alike. Because of catastrophes involving toxic waste, air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and soil erosion, great care is now being taken to monitor the delicate balance between nature and the human use of the earth. Every major project now requires an assessment of its social and environmental impact, creating a large demand for geographers able to integrate the work of specialists in both the social and natural sciences.\nMost students completing the BA Specialization or Honours Urban Planning intend to work in some area of the planning field. Certain students upon graduation find employment with municipal, parapublic or private consulting agencies, generally in technical or support areas. Others continue at the Master's level at other universities; in these cases, the Specialization or Honours degree can be an additional advantage in the competition for the limited number of places in graduate schools and a sufficiently high GPA is a must. A double Major or Major-Minor combination can be useful in keeping one's options open after the Bachelor's degree or may simply offer a way of studying in several disciplines.\nPlanners work in municipal, regional and provincial planning departments as well as for school and medical services boards, public housing agencies and municipal administration. Planning in the private sector of the economy is done by real estate development firms, consulting firms working for development companies, retailing chains, industrial or office location firms. Opportunities also exist in institutional planning at the management level. While the purposes and subject areas vary widely, similar approaches and methods are found in all of these work environments.\nStudents who intend to work in the town planning field should take special note of the following legal restrictions: the Ordre des urbanistes du Québec (OUQ) will admit graduates of certain Québec and Canadian programmes of study, upon completion of a two-year supervised stage and an entry examination. Completion of the Bachelor's degree at Concordia cannot lead to membership in the OUQ, which confers the exclusive right in Québec to call oneself a \"planner\" or \"urbaniste\". Membership is rarely required by employers although it is sometimes said to be useful in setting up a consultancy. Elsewhere in Canada, the voluntary association is the Canadian Institute of Planners/Institut canadien des urbanistes and their provincial affiliates which also accredit programmes of study and admit members, although planners there are also not required to become members and may call themselves \"planners\" or \"urbanistes\" without membership. For a list of accredited planning programmes at the undergraduate and graduate level in Canada and the US, go to www.cip-icu.ca  (\"Student Zone\" and then \"University Programs\"). The CIP-ICU website also has job listings under the heading \"Employment Services\"); for US jobs one place to look is http://www.planetizen.com/jobs. It is usual in the town planning field for formally trained planners to work alongside architects and landscape architects with little professional distinction.\nOther planners do not have their own professional association and will be seen as technical advisors or administrators by their respective working organizations.\nOther graduates will be interested in policy analysis and public administration, for which a broadly based background in Urban Studies can be seen as sound preparation. For these students it would be desirable to increase the number of 300- and 400-level courses in Economics, Political Science and Geography as part of the elective load. Private corporations also employ policy analysts, for which an understanding of finance, business practice and management is an asset.\nStudents wishing to fill technical positions in the private and public sectors involved with services provided to the public should acquire analytical skill using computer, computer mapping and geographical information systems (GIS). Technical positions in planning increasingly require knowledge of computer-assisted design and GIS. Environmental impact assessment where humans, landscapes, architectural heritage or esthetics are concerned will often be carried out by planners or allied professionals from architecture and geography.\nThe Urban Studies courses are intended to provide the theory, the historical and legal background required for application in the field. All courses involve the development of analytical skills useful in a great number of work areas not specially mentioned above.\nThe prospects for job placement change with economic cycles. There are niches of significantly greater demand that may not be lasting. Flexibility that comes from broad preparation is important but good analytical and communication skills are more important. Ultimately employers are most interested in the specific skills, interest and abilities you bring to their environment.\nEnvironmental science training prepares you for many types of careers with a wide variety of employers in the private, public and academic sectors such as, climatology environmental impact assessment, resource conservation, urban and regional planning, housing and community development, environmental consultant, Geographic Information Systems analyst, water scientist, teaching.\nHere are some of the careers that recent Concordia graduates have:\nresearcher with NAFTA Commission for Environmental Co-operation\nresearcher at the Secretariat for the UN Convention on Biodiversity\nresearcher for an engineering and consulting company\nnational parks planner\nteacher (primary, secondary, college and university)\ncity planner, regional planner\ngeographic branch of Statistics Canada\ntransportation planner\nTwo areas are growing rapidly at the moment, creating hundreds of new jobs: Geographic Information Systems and Environmental Studies.

Urban Planning provides courses involving field studies, planning projects and the acquisition of technical skills. The programs provide a foundation for further studies in planning or related fields and training for work in the planning, real estate, and social service fields. A transfer into BA Urban Planning (Specialization) from another program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7 on a 4.3 scale. The BA Urban Planning (Honours) requires the completion of a thesis based on research carried out by the student under the supervision of a professor. Transfer into the Honours program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 on a 4.3 scale.\nExchange Agreements and Study Abroad\nConcordia University has a number of official exchange agreements with universities abroad. For example, the agreement with the University of Dundee in Scotland has allowed Concordia students to study there for one year while paying Québec tuition fees. The year of study there can be fully credited toward a year of study (30 credits) at Concordia. Study abroad should only be contemplated in the second year of a three-year program.\nUnder a global exchange agreement covering all Québec universities, it is also possible to undertake a year of study in a French university and have these studies fully credited toward the Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Each case will be examined separately. French universities charge modest tuition fees but students are expected to be fully self-supporting. German universities will also accommodate visiting students but it will be necessary to pass a German language proficiency test upon arrival. Concordia International has an expanding roster of universities which can be attended by Concordia students.\nVisit Concordia International  for a listing of our current partner institutions.\nLibraries in Montreal\nThe planning collections of the four universities in Montreal are accessible to Concordia students. Journals are sometimes carried by more than one institution but many journals are only available at one university. Undergraduate students may borrow only from Concordia University but you may consult the extensive collections at, for example, Blackader-Lauterman Library at McGill or the Bibliothèque de l'aménagement at the Université de Montréal.\nUrban Studies students may also become student members of the Canadian Centre for Architecture. Membership will grant you discounts on purchases and entry to the Centre. You may also visit (and browse) their excellent bookstore. You may also arrange to consult documents in the specialized library of the CCA.\nMcGill's bookstore also carries an interesting range of titles. One of the better bookstores carrying planning and architecture titles is Olivieri.\nBack to top\n"}

This agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change and requires, as of 2020, regular reporting on progress.\nCountries of the world have officially embarked on a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the planetary scale.\nThis process is not unlike the Olympic Games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition.\nIn this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues — a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada — produced a progress report on the country’s climate actions over the past year. We analyzed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars .\nCanada took two important steps forward. First, the federal government will price carbon throughout the country starting in 2018. Second, the $120 billion infrastructure investment plan explicitly highlights support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nThis investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes.\nDespite this progress, the decision to approve the Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the federal government to meaningfully tackle climate change. The impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase British Columbia’s emissions by 8.5 per cent.\nContinued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada’s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused.\nCanadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth.\nThis requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector and academia to discuss how to reorient subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry, promote transitions to low-carbon energy, while ensuring that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills to other sectors.\nAmbitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever in North America. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up to the expectations it rose by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Despite positive steps, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently.\nRead the Sustainable Canada Dialogues progress report on climate actions at the federal level, authored by Concordia’s Damon Matthews and more than 60 other scholars from across the country.\n \n*For Sustainable Canada Dialogues: Catherine Potvin, McGill University; Sally Aitken, University of British Columbia; François Anctil, Université Laval; Elena Bennett, McGill University; Fikret Berkes, University of Manitoba; Steven Bernstein, University of Toronto; Nathalie Bleau, Ouranos; Bryson Brown, University of Lethbridge; Sarah Burch, University of Waterloo; Jim Byrne, University of Lethbridge; Irena Creed, Western University; Ashlee Cunsolo, Memorial University; Ann Dale, Royal Roads University; Deborah de Lange, Ryerson University; Bruno Dyck, University of Manitoba; Martin  Entz, University of Manitoba; Jose Etcheverry, York University; Adam Fenech, University of Prince Edward Island; Lauchlan Fraser, Thompson Rivers University; Irene Henriques, York University; Andreas Heyland, Guelph University; George Hoberg, University of British Columbia; Meg Holden, Simon Fraser University; Matthew Hoffmann, University of Toronto; Gordon Huang, University of Regina; Aerin Jacob, University of Victoria; Sébastien Jodoin, McGill University; Alison Kemper, Ryerson University; Marc Lucotte, Université de Québec à Montréal; Ralph Matthews, University of British Columbia; Damon Matthews, Concordia University; Ian Mauro, University of Winnipeg; Liat Margolis, University of Toronto; Jeffrey, McDonnell, University of Saskatchewan; James Meadowcroft, Carleton University; Christian Messier, Université de Québec en Outaouais; Martin Mkandawire, Cape Breton University; Catherine Morency, Polytechnique Montréal; Normand Mousseau, Université de Montréal; Ken Oakes, Cape Breton University; Sally Otto, , University of British Columbia; Pamela Palmater, Ryerson University; Taysha S. Palmer, Knowledge Transfer Consultant; Dominique Paquin, Ouranos; Anthony Perl, Simon Fraser University; André Potvin, Université Laval; Ciara Raudsepp-Hearne, Consultant; Howard Ramos, Dalhousie University; John Robinson, University of Toronto; Stephen Sheppard, University of British Columbia; Suzanne Simard, University of British Columbia; Brent Sinclair, Western University; Natalie Slawinski, Memorial University; Mark Stoddart, Memorial University; Shauna Sylvester, Simon Fraser University; Marc-André Villard, Université du Québec à Rimouski; Claude Villeneuve, Université du Québec à Chicoutimi; Sonia Wesche, University of Ottawa.\n \n"}

So, using smartphones, I developed an app to collect my own data.”\nDataMobile\nThe app initially launched as  DataMobile , a 2014 pilot project. Close to 900 people downloaded the app, which prompted them to take part in a survey before it recorded their trips throughout the day using their smartphone.\nDeveloped at Concordia’s  TRIP Lab , the app asked users for information such as their purpose of travel and chosen mode of transport.\n“Its purpose was to test how well we can use smartphones to collect travel data for transportation planning purposes,” says Patterson.\nThe app proved popular, and was used in studies as far away as Ghana. Closer to home, it will be used in five Canadian cities — Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax — as part of this fall's  Canada Food Study .\nMTLTrajet\nThe City of Montreal became interested when Patterson was a mentor at  MTL Cycle Challenge  (MCC), an initiative designed to improve cycling in the city by using data sets to create urban mobility solutions.\nAt MCC, Patterson discussed the DataMobile project with representatives from the city's transport department and the  Montréal, Smart City  initiative.\n“The city is very enthusiastic about the adoption of new technologies in transport-related data collection,” says Patterson. After he was invited to give a presentation on DataMobile for city officials, they asked him to use it as the basis of MTLTrajet.\nIn advance of its October 17 launch, the app is already generating plenty of buzz, on the streets and at City Hall. “It has been great working with the city,” says Patterson. \nConverting data to information\nHow will the results help advance Patterson’s research?\nMTLTrajet will help Patterson and other researchers “figure out how to convert mere data to information.”\n“It’s a potentially effective tool because almost everyone carries around smartphones that know where they are, which can collect crucial transportation data,” says Patterson.\nHe emphasizes the app’s data collection is transparent. “The process is completely overt, so that respondents will know what data is being collected from them.”\nIn the long term, Patterson’s goal is to gather enough data to develop algorithms that will make it unnecessary to have any user input at all. Additional studies are already being planned by the University of Toronto, the  Institut national de recherche scientifique ’s Montreal office, the  Agence métropolitaine de transport ,  BIXI , the  STM  and the  Quebec  Ministry of Transport .  A travel survey collection effort is also being developed in Lahore, Pakistan.\nSo, if you’ve spent your summer playing Pokémon GO and are craving a new smartphone pastime while out and about, MTLTrajet may just be your new fall fix.\n“They both operate on smartphones and keep track of the location of the phone,” admits Patterson. “But it is different, in that it's not a game — and uses less battery, I hope!”\nMTLTrajet launches on October 17. \n \n"}

They’ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.”\n‘Proactive changes’\nNow, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city’s administration and local stakeholders, including the university.\nIn tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal’s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets.\nA charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.\n“We understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,” Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.\n“The goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.”\nThe LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A. DeSève Cinema and in the alley itself. The public was invited to engage in “planning-in-situ,” with walks-through, video-photographic analysis and community sketches.\nDiscussions were led by Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor of geography, planning and environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science . He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves — from the spaces, because they are the ultimate users.\nFrom Modernism to democratization\nDe la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used.\nModernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.\n“Modernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn’t very democratic,” he says.\n“The motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.”\n \nFind out more about the Zone Éducation-Culture , Concordia’s new artistic hub on Bishop Street in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts.\n \n"}

Now this work has earned him a top national honour — membership in the Royal Society of Canada’s College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists .\nFormed in 2014 to recognize intellectual leaders and pioneers in Canada from a variety of fields, the college already boasts the membership of four Concordia researchers — Steven High , Erin Manning and Vincent Martin were included in the inaugural cohort, and Muthukumaran Packirisamy was inducted last year. Matthews is immensely honoured to represent Concordia within the college.\n“This is a fantastic opportunity to meet and interact with a group of really interesting young scholars and researchers,” Matthews says. “I’m especially grateful to Concordia for their role in putting my nomination forward — this university has been a wonderful environment in which to build my academic career, and I would like to thank the many people here who have supported me both personally and professionally.”\nThrough his research, Matthews has shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. This work has improved understandings of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems and how best to respond to the challenge of climate mitigation.\n“Recognition from a prestigious body like the Royal Society of Canada is extremely gratifying,” says Graham Carr, interim provost and vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies. “The fact that Concordia faculty members continue to receive this honour is a further demonstration of the important contributions that our research makes to the betterment of Canadian society.”\nConcordia is also the institutional sponsor of the College, a tribute to the university's commitment to next-generation researchers.\n"}

It is the questions that geography asks about places, landscapes, and the environment that distinguish it from other subdivisions of knowledge. Geography is a broad and diverse discipline that examines interrelationships and interconnections, while stressing synthesis, a worthy goal of scholarship, given the lingering penchant for reductionism and ever finer divisions of knowledge.\nGeographers are familiar with how natural systems function; they know that humans are a dominant agent of change in nature; they are interested in the attitudes, values, and ideas that cultural groups attach to their surroundings; they have a heritage of thinking about plants, animals, people, and the environment as an inseparable complex; and they have long been interested in the areal association and spatial organization of both natural and anthropogenic phenomena on the earth's surface. As a result, geography is well-placed to act as a bridge between the social sciences and humanities on the one hand and the physical and biological sciences on the other. From such a central position, it is inevitable that geographers fan out along a variety of academic paths, and that these paths will cross, mingle, or converge with those of other disciplines. By its very nature geography is a discipline that seeks to integrate and synthesize knowledge. Therein lies its strength. The geographer's world is your world: it is the earth as the home of humans.\nWhy study geography?\nBecause we need to identify and analyze the global, regional, and local structures and processes that affect our daily lives. Because as the world becomes more interdependent, the need for the integrative geographical perspective will increase. Because trying to make sense of the world is an endlessly exciting challenge.\nGeographers ask a diverse set of questions such as:\nCan the global environment cope with anticipated population growth?\nWhat will be the extent and impact of global warming?\nShould we protect tropical forests and why are they being destroyed?\nWhat causes famine and why do people die from it?\nWhy and where do people migrate or flee?\nShould we allow Hydro Quebec to dam the rivers entering James Bay?\nMuch of what happens in our daily lives is influenced by events beyond our ‘local world’ – events often beyond our borders and outside the control of our national governments. As the world’s nations and environment become more interdependent, the need to understand how our lives are interconnected across the globe increases. With it the role of geography and employment opportunities for geographers will continue to grow.\nGeography at Concordia\n"}

It requires an understanding of the dynamics of climatology, hydrology, biogeography, geology and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.\nEnvironmental geography represents a critically important set of analytical tools for assessing the impact of human presence on the environment by measuring the result of human activity on natural landforms and cycles. This program draws on courses within physical geography, including a distinctive strand of courses dealing with environmental issues, resources and management. Teaching and learning methods are diverse, ranging from lectures and tutorials through to a variety of practical work in cartography, GIS, remote sensing and statistics.\nEnvironmental geographers are familiar with how natural systems function, but they also know that humans are a dominant agent of change in nature. They realize that it is not possible to understand environmental problems without understanding the physical processes as well as the demographic, cultural, and economic processes that lead to increased resource consumption and waste.

Road effects model for predicting when animal populations are at risk from roads: an interactive model of road avoidance behaviour\n- Click here to start the model -\nRoads and traffic affect animal populations detrimentally in four ways: they decrease habitat amount and quality, enhance mortality due to collisions with vehicles, prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and subdivide animal populations into smaller and more vulnerable fractions. Roads will affect persistence of animal populations differently depending on (1) road avoidance behavior of the animals (i.e., noise avoidance, road surface avoidance, and car avoidance); (2) population sensitivity to the four road effects; (3) road size; and (4) traffic volume. We have created a model based on these population and road characteristics to study the questions: (1) what types of road avoidance behaviors make populations more vulnerable to roads?; (2) what types of roads have the greatest impact on population persistence?; and (3) how much does the impact of roads vary with the relative population sensitivity to the four road effects?\nOur results suggest that, in general, the most vulnerable populations are those with high noise and high road surface avoidance, and secondly, those with high noise avoidance only. Conversely, the least vulnerable populations are those with high car avoidance only, and secondly, high road surface and high car avoidance. Populations with low overall road avoidance and those with high overall road avoidance tend to respond in opposite ways when the sensitivity to the four road effects is varied. The same is true of populations with high road surface avoidance when compared to those with high car and high noise avoidance. The model further predicted that traffic volume has a larger effect than road size on the impact of roads on population persistence. One potential application of our model is to generate predictions for more structured field studies of road avoidance behavior and its influence on persistence of wildlife populations.\nPublished in Jaeger et al.

What are the objectives of environmental science?\nDr. Martin Scheringer and I want to start a critical discussion of this question. Therefore, we investigate the kinds of research questions asked by environmental scientists. To do this, we are taking a closer look at four questions:\nWhat is the lack of knowledge to be addressed by the research?\nWhat is the purpose of the results?\nWhat are the subjects the research is dealing with?\nWhat are the methods chosen for the investigation?\nWe propose that problem-oriented environmental science should strive to find answers to these questions that are different from those offered by ‘classical’ natural sciences.\nThe reason is that in the treatment of environmental problems, there is often a discrepancy between the needs of dicision makers and the results provided by scientific research (what we call the “datadilemma”). To explore how this discrepancy could be reduced, we make a distinction between knowledge-oriented and decision-oriented reduction of complexity. The challenge that today's environmental research is facing is that decision-oriented reduction of complexity should be incorporated in the selection of scientific problems. We use the guiding principle of “reflexive environmental research” and point out how it differs from the guiding principles of “classical scientific research”. Its key elements are: reflection of guiding ideas external to science (e.g., sustainability); addressing explicitly the uncertainty and openness of scientific results and forecasts (including unknown unknowns); transdisciplinarity; the aim of contributing to the solution of complex and controversial real-world problems; adherence to relevant scientific standards.\nYou find more information and you are invited to contribute to the discussion here: www.env-science.ethz.ch\n9.

The Honours thesis can be considered as a \"trial run\" for a graduate thesis.\nApplying for Honours\nAn application for transfer into an Honours program is typically made in May, and the Honours Thesis course begins in September. Admission into Honours requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 on a 4.3 scale, no grade lower than a C, and the agreement of a full-time or affiliated assistant professor to supervise the Honours thesis research. An undergraduate advisor submits an electronic application on the applicant's behalf once the academic year is complete at the end of April, and the transfer to Honours is decided by a committee in the Faculty of Arts and Science administration. Once the transfer has been made, the student should seek academic advising for changes to their registration. Usually they will take the 6-credit Honours course, GEOG 491 or URBS 491, beginning in the fall of their final academic year. Some students are given automatic admission into an Honours program, but they must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 to enroll in GEOG 491 or URBS 491.\nIn the second-to-last year of your program, you should start thinking about what research topic you would be interested in investigating, and which full-time or affiliated assistant professor could supervise your project. One good way to start is to look at the web pages of the faculty members in the department  (http://www.gpe.concordia.ca/research/) . You will be able to see the type of research conducted by your professors, and you will see their latest publications. Some professors have already thought of projects that they would like Honours students to investigate, so you can also ask professors if they have ideas for you.\nSummer Work To Get You Prepared\nOne great way of getting to know what type of research is undertaken in the Department is to work as a research assistant during the summer. If you have a strong GPA and you are in the B.Sc. program (or if you are interested in working on a natural science project), you can apply for the Undergraduate Student Research Scholarships ( USRA ) from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). Note that the professor needs to hold a grant from NSERC in order to supervise your USRA. In addition, there is a new  pilot program at Concordia  that is the equivalent of NSERC USRA. Otherwise, you can approach your professor either in class or by e-mail and ask if he/she has research funds to hire an undergraduate student for the summer. In many cases, Honours students have used their summer work in the Department to start collecting their data for their Honours thesis.\nHonours Thesis Course\nIn the Honours Thesis course, students are expected to complete original research under supervision. The scope of the project will be decided between each student and his/her supervisor. It is anticipated that students will emerge from the program with basic skills in formulating and testing hypotheses, experimental design, data analysis and presentation, critical evaluation of published work and scientific writing; all of the skills required of a good graduate student. It is not essential that the project produce positive results leading to clear, definitive conclusions. Projects may yield negative results or no clear results at all. This is the nature of scientific research. It is expected, however, that each project will address a clearly defined research question and that students will learn much about the scientific method in the process of completing the project. The mark in this course will be assigned based on the quality of the two oral presentations and the written thesis which is evaluated by the instructor of the course, the supervisor and an external reader from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.\nThinking about graduate studies\nEarly in your final year in the BA or BSc Honours program, you may wish to start thinking about graduate studies. There are several external scholarships available for research-based Master's programs both in social science (Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) at the federal level, and Fonds de Recherche Québec Société Culture (FRQSC) at the provincial level) and natural science (Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) at the federal level and Fonds de Recherche Québec - Nature et Technologies (FRQNT) at the provincial level). These scholarships are highly competitive (minimum GPA of 3.7/4.3), but they offer a minimum level of funding of $15,000 per year. The deadline to submit your application is usually in October for a scholarship starting the following academic year. More information on these scholarships can be found at the following sites:\n"}

The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and statistical analysis.\nResearch in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city. Recently, a smartphone application ( DataMobile ) has been developed to conduct origin-destination of members of the Concordia community.\nResearch on urban transportation at Concordia:\n"}

He received his PhD in City and Regional Planning from Cornell University (2014). He has taught Urban Design and Planning, Urban Sociology, Public Space Studios, History of Urbanism and Architecture, Architectural Studio and Environmental Psychology at The Autonomous University of Tamaulipas and Anahuac University in Mexico and Cornell University. He has studied contesting uses of public space, such as street vending, graffiti,public assembly and protest, as urban design/planning agents. His dissertation explores alternative planning processes in the context of protest encampments in horizontal social movements. He did research and participated in the Indignados mobilizations in Barcelona,Occupy Wall Street and other social movements in2011 and 2012. \nTeaching activities\nURBS 333 - URBAN LABORATORY (Fall 2015 and Winter 2016)\nThis course focuses on exploring urban planning/design strategies andtactics to “re-stitch” – socially and physically – interstitial spaces thatcreate fragmentation in the urban fabric. It particularly focuses on urbaninfrastructure, such as elevated highways, multi-level vehicular intersections,(post)industrial complexes, railroads and railyards. The interruptions thatthese spaces create in the urban fabric are not only due to their physicalcondition, but also because there is a difference in the social, spatial andinstitutional scale. These spaces are often under national or provincialgovernment jurisdictions (i.e. highways and railroads) or even transnationalregulations (i.e. international corporations), and therefore are detached fromcommunity and neighborhood-level dynamics.\nThe ultimate objective of the course is to explore the challenges andopportunities is to create city out of in interstitial spaces. To explore theseissue, this course will draw from theories that intersect community planning,urban acupuncture, landscape urbanism, infrastructure planning and public spacestudies as well as case studies around the world in which planners and urbandesigners have successfully (or unsuccessfully) dealt with these kinds ofproblems. It also draws from cultural landscape studies in order to understandthe socio-cultural divisions that are created by such urban conditions. Thecourse will focus on laboratory work on the case of the Saint Henri Quartier inMontreal, QC.  This neighborhood,delimited by Highway 720, the Lachine Canal and Atwater Avenue, has many of thecharacteristics described above, and it is an outstanding opportunity to testplanning/design and policy strategies for urban regeneration in fragmentedspaces. This formerly working-class and gentrifying neighborhood is fragmentedby postindustrial infrastructure that otherwise represented common spaces.However, its rich popular culture and history gives the neighborhood aresilience that enables for (re)appropriation and (re)signification of the space.\nThe solutions suggested for this laboratory are not “major-surgery-like”ones that require large demolitions and construction of existinginfrastructure, but rather mild interventions that can turn the socio-spatialdynamics around in the urban fabric. Interventions such as graffiti murals, artinstallations, farmer markets, community gardens, and events such as festivals,concerts or neighborhood meetings are particularly encouraged. The studentswill use community-engagement methods (i.e. participatory action research, filmprojections, charrettes, planning-in-situ, place-making) to test thesemethodologies in the selected sites. \nURBS 490 - PUBLIC SPACE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST (Winter 2016)\nUrban space shapes publics,and publics (re)shape urban space. Public space is the result of this dialecticrelationship. Public space is also the physical manifestation of the publicinterest, and therefore is also the manifestation of conflict. However, publicspace and the public sphere is also the realm to debate about and solve thoseconflicts. This seminar explores how the notion of the public and public spaceplays a key role in the construction of democratic societies. It broadlyexplores the socioeconomic, cultural, political and physical dimensions ofpublic space. It particularly focuses on the tensions between how space isproduced and how it is (re)appropriated and (re)produced by its citizens, withthe objective of drawing lessons to enable a more democratic, inclusive andjust city-making. Drawing form theory, history and case studies, thisseminar analyzes how public spaces are planned and how different subjectivitiesemerged from those spaces, as well as how these subjectivities transform andreinvent themselves to change the spaces they inhabit. The notions of exclusionand inclusion, gender/race/age/class equity, gentrification and privatizationof public space, problems and potential of social networks, protest and theright to the city, as well as place-making and community planning would bewidely explored.\nThe course is divided into twoparts:\n1.    Typologies of public space and subjectivities – During the first part of the class, wewill analyze different types of spaces that encourage and discourage certainactivities in space and therefore create different subjectivities and ways of“being-in-the-world” (e.g. plazas, parks, promenades, etc.)\n2.    Academic and Civic Debates on public space andthe public interest – In thesecond part of the course, we will analyze and build on the current debatesabout how to plan, manage, regulate, design, use and occupy public space (e.g.privatization of public space, gentrification, protest and occupation of publicspace, paradoxes of the social networks in public spaces, etc.)\n. \nPublications\nUrban Resistance: Alternative Interpretations of Public Space (English/revised version) (2014) in Viladevall & Castrillo (2010), Espacio Publico en la Ciudad Contemporanea, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, España.\nAbstract Drawing from a historical analysis of informal uses of urban space in Mexico, this chapter analyzes uses and interpretations of public spaces that clash with their planning and design programs. It particularly explores the notion of urban resistance, understood as alternative readings of space that contest urban regulations and spatial programs and, as practices that remain in spite of historical and cultural transformations. The chapter concludes by reinterpreting a modernist esplanade in a hospital and by providing design proposals that incorporate amenities and an informal market to an otherwise precarious space.\nProtest Encampments as Urban Laboratories: The 15M Barcelona Encampment: A Space of Resistance and Creativity (2014) in Progressive Planning, Planner's Network, New York, NY.\nAbstract The protest encampments of 2011 operated as spaces of resistance-through-creativity.Without an apparent overarching structure, the protesters engaged in different forms of interaction, encounter and organization. The spontaneous processes used to organize the physical space of the encampments provided lessons for the democratization of planning and city-making processes. Rather than in what was done in the encampments, the true lessons are more in how things were done –through mechanics that allowed potentially anyone from within or without the movement to actively participate in its development. To explore these ideas,this article makes a brief account of the case of the Barcelona Encampment in Plaza Catalunya in the Spring of 2011.\nOpen-ended urbanisms: Space-making processes in the protest encampment of the Indignados movement in Barcelona (2015) in URBAN DESIGN International\nAbstract This paper studies the spontaneous and organic processes involved in the physical planning of protest encampments. Drawing from ethnographic work in the context of the Indignados Movement in Barcelona,it analyzes the spatial evolution and transformation of the Plaza Catalunya encampment in 2011. The encampments evolved in parallel to the conversations and questions that originated them online and offline. Thus, it particularly examines the notions of open planning (i.e. open-source and open-ended decision-making processes) and urban laboratories that the fieldwork indicates were tested in the space of the encampment. The objective is to understand how urban space can be planned through non-hierarchical space-making processes and without a homogeneous overarching structure. This paper situates in a larger discussion about alternative space-making processes such as insurgent, tactical planning,as well as in the recent conversations about open-source cities. \nKeywords: public space, insurgent planning, protest encampments, social movements, open-source cities; urban design\nBack to top\n"}

{"url": "http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/geography-planning-environment/faculty.html?fpid=zachary-patterson", "field": "artsci_geography", "title": "Faculty", "text": "Tweets by @ProfPatterson\nZachary is Tier-II Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Land Use Linkages for Regional Sustainability. He received his BA (Honours Anthropology) from McGill University in Montreal, his Master's (Economics) from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and PhD (Geography) from McGill. He was also a postdoctoral researcher at the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland in the Transport and Mobility Laboratory ( TRANSP-OR ). Professionally he worked as an economist at the NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation and as transportation modeler at the Montreal regional public transportation planner, l'Agence métropolitaine de transport. Zachary's research focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages. He is currently a member of the Transportation Research Board's Land Development Committee (ADD30), and of the Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks, Logistics and Transportation ( CIRRELT ).\nTeaching activities\nAdvanced Quantitative Methods\n(Fall 2015)\nOver the course of the semester, students will become familiar with the R programming environment at least for the conducting of statistical analysis, and hopefully also for data manipulation and preparation. They will become familiar with the kinds of statistical analysis that is typically used in the fields of geography, planning and environmental studies. They will also work towards understanding the type of statistical analysis that is likely to be done as part of their master’s thesis. Ideally, as part of the term project, the student will be able to work with the same data set they expect to use in the analysis for their thesis. Alternatively, another data set that resembles the data they expect to use for their thesis will be used.\nIt is open to graduate students. Download most recent course outline  here .\nAnalyzing Choice\n(Winter 2014)\nOver the course of this class, students learn to design, implement and analyse the data, from a stated choice survey. The topic of the survey will have to do with an important environmental question. It is open to undergraduate and undergraduate students. Download the most recent undergraduate course outline here .\nTransportation GIS\n(Winter 2016)\nDownload the latest course outline .    This course introduces students to the transportation    planning and modeling process aided by the use of a    GIS-based transportation decision aid tool. A real-world    case-study region and transportation system is used     to illustrate the different elements of the planning     and modeling process. The course aims to highlight     both the strengths and weaknesses (particularly with     regards to how it treats the interaction between the     transportation system and land-use) of the traditional     transportation planning approach.\nResearch activities\nCurrent research projects\nL’utilisation des téléphones intelligents pour la collecte de données sur les habitudes de déplacement individuelles (FRSC - Nouveaux chercheurs), Principal Investigator\nEntente de recherche et devéloppement (Agence métropolitaine de transport - AMT), Principal investigator\nNouveau Modèle Urbain: vers la mise en place d'un cadre intégré de modélisation du développement urbain et des transports dans la région de Montréal (Ministère des Transports du Québec), Principal-investigator, Co-PI: Ahmed El-Geneidy, School of Urban Planning, McGill University\nCanada Research Chair in Transportation-Land-use linkages and regional sustainability (SSHRC), Prinicipal-investigator\nOperating Grant: Preference stability in transportation and land-use modeling for sustainable transportation (SSHRC), principal investigator.\nSecurité des carrefours giratoires au Québec (FQRNT), collaborator.\nEmpirical analysis of the relationship between urban form, public transit supply and transport sector greenhouse gas emissions in the Quebec urban context (FQRNT), collaborator.\nCirculation et qualité de l’air : Parachèvement de l’Autoroute 25 (Ministère des transports, Québec), collaborator.\nSelected publications\nRefereed publications\nSimon Saddier, Zachary Patterson, Alex Johnson and Natalie Wiseman.

The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for  geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student  researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and  land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the  country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and  sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and  statistical analysis.\nResearch  in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment,  land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect  data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city.

At present I am exploring the relationships between containershipping networks and logistics and am collaborating with a colleague inFrance to assess the ability of intermediate hubs to attract logisticsactivities. My interests have also been turning to consider bulk shipping. Recently, I have been working on projects for Transport Canada ondeveloping performance indicators for Canadian bulk terminals, and onassessing the implications for Canadian bulk ports of the rapid upscalingin ship sizes in the world fleet.\nSelected publications\nArticles\nFranc, P., Gouvernal, E. and Slack, B.
