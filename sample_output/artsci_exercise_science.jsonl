However, few studies have investigated the relationship between objective daily assessment of sleep and COPD disease severity and prognosis. A component of sleep regulation is influenced by the circadian cycle. A few studies have demonstrated a relationship with the circadian measure of amplitude and worst outcomes in multiple conditions, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and hypertension. However, to our knowledge, no study has reported on the circadian rest-activity cycle in COPD patients. Therefore, the aim of my project is to i) investigate the relationship between sleep and COPD disease severity and prognosis and ii) investigate the relationship between the relative amplitude of the rest-activity cycle and COPD disease severity and prognosis.\nCoupling of neural oscillations in sleep, in relation to cognition and aging\nJordan O’Byrne (MSc candidate, Supervisor Dr. Thanh Dang-Vu)\nNeuronal oscillations dominate the sleeping brain, where they are believed to orchestrate the consolidation of newly formed memories. Age-related cognitive decline may be mediated by disruptions in these mnemonic sleep rhythms. A recently identified feature of neuronal oscillations, theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling, has been linked with learning and memory processes in animals and humans. Theta-gamma coupling may operate at the intersection of sleep, cognition and aging, mediating the effect of sleep on memory and in turn, the effects of aging on cognition. The goal of this study is to describe phase-amplitude coupling during human sleep, and how it is affected by learning and by aging. Young and elderly participants will complete a memory task and a control task on two non-consecutive nights, followed in each case by a polysomnographic recording of their sleep. Differences in coupling during sleep will be compared across tasks and across age groups, and will be correlated with next-day memory performance. This will be the first study to examine phase-amplitude coupling dynamics during human sleep, and the first to compare them across age groups. In addition, results of this study may elucidate mechanisms of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, and may lead to the identification of an early biomarker of age-related cognitive pathology.\nInvestigation of lower limb muscle reaction to multidiretional perturbation.\nLishani Mahendrarajah (MSc candidate, Supervisor  Dr. Richard DeMont ):\nThe objective of this study is to understand lower limb muscle activity in female athletes prior to, during, and following multidirectioinal perturbations. This information can be used to understand the mechanism of ACL injuries in female athletes and to determine exercise intervention programs targeting leg injury prevention. \n \nInter-Observer and Inter-Method Variability in the Determination of the Ventilatory Threshold in Healthy Individuals and Those With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\nBruno-Pierre Dubé MD, MSc candidate (Supervisor  Dr Véronique Pepin )\nThe ventilatory threshold is a useful clinical marker of global aerobic fitness, used both for exercise prescription and as a prognostic marker in many diseases. Its identification on an incremental exercise tests relies on manual manipulation of graphical data, and therefore is prone to error. In COPD patients, the ventilatory threshold may be particularly difficult to identify owing to their abnormal respiratory response to exercise. This projects aims to quantify and compare the magnitude of the inter-observer variability in the measurement of the ventilatory threshold in both healthy and COPD subjects. We expect our results to provide more insight about the meaning and usefulness of the measured value of the ventilatory threshold in COPD patients, a finding that could have clinical implications when, for example, an exercise training program is considered for these patients.\nTime-Of-Day Variations in Physical Activity in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\nZohra Parwanta MSc candidate (Supervisor  Dr Véronique Pepin ) \nIn previous work from our group, diurnal variations (variations within a day) in lung function and exercise response were found in a considerable proportion of individuals with COPD. It is possible that this subgroup of patients with greater variability have a circadian rhythm with larger amplitude, which may predict a better clinical outcome in COPD, as in other pathologies such as hypertension and cancer. The aim of this study is to examine whether amplitude of the rest-activity cycle (as a measure of circadian rhythms) is associated with physical activity levels in COPD patients. The hypothesis is that COPD patients with a larger amplitude in rest-activity cycle will have greater physical activity levels than those with a smaller amplitude. Levels and patterns of physical activity will also be compared between COPD patients, and healthy controls subjects.\nAmplitude of the Rest-Activity Cycle and Disease Severity and Progression in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\nEmilie Chan-Thim, PhD. candidate (Supervisor  Dr Véronique Pepin )\nRest-activity measures, obtained through actigraphy, can be used to calculate amplitude of the rest-activity cycle, an indicator of the internal synchrony between physiological functions and the circadian clock. It has been hypothesized that low amplitudes of the rest-activity cycle may predict worst clinical outcomes; this has been supported in multiple conditions such as in cancer, Alzheimer’s and hypertension. The objective of this project is to investigate the link between amplitude of the rest-activity cycle and variables of disease severity and progression in in individuals with COPD.\nAcute Physiological, Symptomatic, and Affective Responses to Different Exercise-Training Protocols and Relationship with Adherence to Pulmonary Rehabilitation in COPD\n \nAmanda K. Rizk, PhD (Supervisor  Dr Véronique Pepin )\nIn healthy individuals, lower exercise intensities are thought to be more enjoyable, leading to better program adherence. It has been hypothesized that, in patients with COPD, exercise intensities associated with less physiological and symptomatic strain may improve affective response compared to higher training intensities, resulting in better exercise adherence to a 12-week pulmonary rehabilitation program. The objectives of this project were to: i) compare, in COPD, the acute physiological, symptomatic, and affective responses to three commonly used exercise-training protocols; ii) examine the association between acute responses and adherence to a 12-week exercise-training program; and iii) investigate whether the relationship between acute responses and adherence is mediated/moderated by affect/vigor.\nLearn more\n"}

These impacts, especially those to the front and top of the helmet, are primarily responsible for the high prevalence of concussions and spine injuries.\nCumulative head impacts that are of a ‘sub-concussive’ level are gaining increasing scrutiny with the growing research in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Ironically, a football helmet enables players to more willingly sustain head contact because of the protection it affords; a phenomenon called ‘risk compensation’. Due to the nature of football, removing the helmet entirely from the sport is not appropriate. However, there is no regulation that prevents a football player from practicing blocking and tackling without a helmet to solidify a technique which naturally leaves the head out of contact. This session will present background information and early findings of the HuTTTM helmetless tackling training program.\n"}

It's World Sleep Day. How important is a good night's rest?", "text": "Shhhh! It’s World Sleep Day\nConcordia researchers Jennifer McGrath and Thanh Dang-Vu investigate the crucial developmental and cognitive benefits of shut-eye\nPosted on March 18, 2016\n|\nSource: University Communications Services\n“Sleep might be one of these aspects that helps preserve a good memory and cognitive function,” says Thanh Dang-Vu, a Concordia researcher. | Photo by Concordia University\nIt’s World Sleep Day ! What better time to celebrate Concordians working in the field of sleep research?\nLooking at everyone from children to the elderly, Concordia’s researchers are studying the patterns, influences and consequences of sleep.\nJennifer McGrath: stress and sleep\n“My research focuses on how sleep impacts heart health and obesity in children — specifically, why poor families have poor health,” says Jennifer McGrath , associate professor in the Department of Psychology and Concordia’s inaugural PERFORM Chair in Childhood Preventive Health and Data Science. \"The stress of being poor gets under their skin, literally, and stress seems to make its biggest impact while we're sleeping.\"\nHere, at the 2015 Chancellor’s Builders Dinner, McGrath’s discusses how sleep is critical for good health:\n&amp;nbsp;\nA new study from September 2015, led by researchers Jinshia Ly, McGrath and Jean-Philippe Gouin from Concordia’s Centre for Clinical Research in Health (CCRH) and the PERFORM Centre , shows that poor sleep might explain how stress impacts health in kids.\n“Getting a good night’s sleep might buffer the impact of stress on kids’ cortisol level, which is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland to regulate the body’s cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems,” says McGrath, also the director of Concordia’s Pediatric Public Health Psychology (PPHP) Laboratory . “Long-term exposure to cortisol can put people at risk for health problems, like heart diseases, weight gain and depression.”\nThis study was part of the larger, ongoing Healthy Heart Project directed by McGrath. It was made possible by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Operating Grant awarded to McGrath and the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé bourse de formation maîtrise awarded to Ly. The CIHR funding was renewed and the project is funded until 2020.\nThanh Dang-Vu: ageing and sleep\nWhat is the relationship between sleep and cognition in older adults?\nNeurologist Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor in the Department of Exercise Science, is currently recruiting people over the age of 65 for a sleep study to get some answers. \nThanh Dang-Vu: “Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases.”\n“Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases,” says Dang-Vu, Concordia Research Chair in Sleep, Neuroimaging and Cognitive Health at Concordia’s Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology and the PERFORM Centre, is also a medical doctor at the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal .\n“In the general population, chronic insomnia, which is insomnia for more than three months, is about 10 to 15 per cent. In the elderly, people older than 65, insomnia rates can be between 30 and 34 per cent, or one third of the population — at least double that of younger people,” he says. \nThat's a problem, Dang-Vu explains, because the population is more fragile. Insomniacs have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Too often, insomnia is treated with sleeping pills and patients become dependent.\nCognition concerns\n“We’ve recruited 20 participants over 65 years of age who take benzodiazepines — like Ativan, Klonopin and Serax, for example — to spend the night at our sleep lab,” says Dang-Vu, who won the 2015 Roger Broughton Young Investigator Award from the  Canadian Sleep Society  in recognition of his significant early career contributions to the field of sleep research in Canada.\n“We’re offering them a treatment called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),” says Dang-Vu, who wants to see if CBTI will improve their cognition.\n“If that's the case, it would emphasize the importance of treating insomnia for maintaining good cognitive function with age,” he says. “With age, we have a larger risk of developing memory problems. Sleep might be one of these aspects that help prevent the development of dementia. It’s important to look at that.”\nThe study is funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé and the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal.\nFor more information about Thanh Dang-Vu’s sleep lab, visit the Facebook page.\nTo participate in Dang-Vu’s sleep study, contact study coordinator Caroline Desrosiers at 514-340-3540, ext. 4790, or email caroline.desrosiers@criugm.qc.ca .\n \n"}

Really?\nWell, yes.\n“As we get closer to the big game, I don't expect anything to change,” Laporte says. “It's going to be the same. It was the same during the playoffs. Everyone is expecting something to change, but the players are professionals, and everybody's just doing their job.”\nAn unlikely road to the NFL\nLaporte, a native of Paris, France, came to Concordia in 2004 to pursue a bachelor’s degree in athletic therapy. It was the beginning of a journey to land his dream job with an NFL team .\nWhen he finally secured his position with the Carolina Panthers in 2013, Laporte was elated, but part of him had expected it to happen. After all, he’d put in the necessary time and effort.\n“It took me 10 years, so I was ready in terms of my skills,” he says. “I had to organize myself, of course, get used to the tempo and what was expected, then make sure my English got better, and that's it.”\nLooking back on his three seasons with the Panthers, Laporte says being part of an NFL team is all that he thought it would be, and more.\n“It's always new. Every day is new,” he says. “I expected it to be hard; it's hard. I expected it to be fast; it's fast. I expected the players to be big; they're big.”\nPrayers for Paris\nLooking back on the Panther’s stellar season, Laporte says one game stands out for him: Sunday, November 15, against the Tennessee Titans — two days after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the city where Laporte was born and raised.\n“It was a very, very difficult weekend for me,” he says. “We received great support from all of the team, all of the players. I received phone calls right away, and then there was a minute of silence for people from Paris before every NFL game, with the French flag. That was very special for me.”\n“Then some players gave me items from the game that they signed, that said they played for Paris … I'll keep them, not as a souvenir of what happened two days before, but of the players, of how great these guys can be.”\nVeteran Carolina Panther Charles Tillman gave his cleats to Laporte after the November 15 game against the Tennessee Titans.\nOne game at a time\nSpeaking to Laporte, there’s no doubt that he has a lot of love for his team. But did he expect them to achieve what they did this season? To make it all the way to the Super Bowl?\n“Every year you expect to get to the big game,” he says. “When you're on the team and when you live with the team, you know exactly what the team is made of. So, no, for us it was no surprise. You play one game at a time, and each week, everybody is telling you you're going to lose. And you end up winning, and you keep winning.”\nLaporte treats linebacker Thomas Davis.\nThe story of this season’s Carolina Panthers is a lot like the story of one Jean-Baptiste Laporte — coming in under the radar, working really hard and accomplishing the dream, buoyed by the belief that it’s going to become a reality.\n“Nothing's impossible, you just have to work hard and push through the doors,” he says when asked what he tells aspiring athletic therapists who might be gunning for a career with a professional sports team.\n“I had no connections coming here. I just had to keep pushing and pushing, and work hard. At one point somebody's going to notice that.\n“Most of them are very, very talented therapy students and they like what they do. So I tell them all the time, ‘I've no doubt that if you want to do this, you'll be doing it.’”\nDave Jones (1958-2014): teacher, mentor, colleague and friend\nSomebody that has been in Laporte’s thoughts a lot this week, as his team gets closer to Sunday’s kickoff, is David Jones, an athletic therapy instructor in Concordia’s  Department of Exercise Science , who  passed away suddenly on May 20, 2014 .\n“As soon as we won the NFC Championship and we were going to the Super Bowl, I thought about Dave,” Laporte says. “I'm sure he would have made the trip, because he made the trip to the Grey Cup every year. He was very, very instrumental in helping me get to where I am right now. I know he's going to be watching the game, too.”\n"}

How to be smart when it comes to online health advice\nOn May 21, Joe Schwarcz joins Concordia's David Secko and Simon Bacon to separate the good science from the bad\nPosted on May 6, 2016\nFrom left: Simon Bacon, David Secko and Joe Schwarcz\nWhat’s true? What’s not? Who should you trust? Important questions when it concerns your health.\nOn May 21, Concordia professors Simon Bacon and David Secko will join Joe Schwarcz , director of McGill University’s Office for Science and Society, for the public lecture  Social Media and the Rise of Bad Health Information: Tweets, Posts, and Problems . \nThe talk is part of the International Behavioural Trials Network’s 2016 conference  taking place in Montreal from May 19 to 21. We caught up with Bacon, graduate program director in the Department of Exercise Science , in advance of the event.\nHow did you come up with the idea for a lecture on the theme of health and social media?\nSimon Bacon: We know that the majority of people now get their health information online, with a large proportion of it coming from social-media outlets. While there is a lot of good information out there, there is also some questionable information and advice circulating around.\nFor over 10 years, myself, Brian Gabrial and David Secko in the Department of Journalism have had an interest in looking at this, and we’ve organized several academic conferences.\nWe felt now would be a good time to open this discussion to include everyone. Helping people to tell the difference between the \"good\" and the \"bad\" information can be really important.\nHow did you select your panellists?\nSB: We wanted our panel to represent a variety of experiences and viewpoints. Our \"headliner\" Joe Schwarcz is a world-renowned expert in making science and medical discoveries accessible, and an avid social-media user. He really represents an outstanding example of how scientists can talk a common language and provide accessible information for the general public.\nDavid Secko is a fantastic academic who has not only been a reporter, columnist and freelance science writer, but also studies the process of health reporting. He is the lead of the Concordia Science Journalism Project , which looks to actively support, better understand and improve the role of science journalism in Canada.\nFinally, my area of expertise is health behaviour change, and I have been involved in a variety of media events where I not only actively discuss my research but also the process of getting this information into the hands of the general public.\nI am also leading the International Behavioural Trials Network (IBTN), which is co-sponsoring the event. Collectively, I think we are a very knowledgeable, experienced and entertaining group of individuals.\nSome people say social media has led to the rise of medical ignorance: parents refusing to vaccinate their children, for example. What’s your take?\nSB: A little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. A lot of times people make decisions with the best intentions but based on limited or erroneous information. The trick is navigating the huge amount of information that is out there and working out what is reliable and what is not — which is not easy.\nHand-in-hand with that is the willingness of people to embrace that information. It is very easy to develop an opinion and then find information on the internet or social media that supports that position. Helping people to be critical of that information is an important part of the process of developing well-reasoned decisions on health.\nJoe Schwarcz is well known for his dislike of certain bloggers, notably the Food Babe , who has no medical training yet dispenses health advice. How should people approach this type of online advice?\nSB: I think most people have a hard time knowing what information is “trustworthy” and what is not. There has been a growth in the number of social-media personalities who are providing opinions about health issues that are not founded in good science.\nConfounding this is the fact they sometimes actually cover something that is backed up by good science, which allows people to justify their belief in what these people say. This means that it is not only the person but also what they say that needs to be looked at.\nGenerally, if you come across something that is posted or tweeted, it is good to get a \"second opinion.\" Seeing if this information is also reported on reliable health-information sites, for example, WebMD , is a good place to start.\nIf it directly affects a health concern that you have right now, you can also seek information from a health-care professional or call 811. If in doubt, it is always good to speak to someone.\nDo you see potential for advances in medicine through social media?\nSB: As they say, knowledge is power, and arming the general public with the knowledge — and power — to understand medicine and medical advances can be a really positive thing in helping them make good health decisions.\nSocial media is a great tool that can be used in this way. However, understanding what information comes from reliable sources versus less reliable sources and helping the general population to navigate that is important.\nHow do you use social media in your own work?\nSB: We use social media to get information out about the research we are doing, the events we are running and other “good” health information that can be helpful to people.\nWe mostly use Twitter — our lab account is @mbmc_cmcm and IBTN’s is @IBTNetwork — but we also post stuff through our websites.\nWhat do you hope people take away from this event?\nSB: The goal of the event is to try and help people navigate the complex world of health information on the internet and social media. If we can give people some insight into how to get and evaluate information then we'll have done part of our job.\nRegister  for Social Media and the Rise of Bad Health Information: Tweets, Posts, and Problems , which takes place on Saturday, May 21, from 5 to 7 p.m. in the BMO Amphitheatre (Room MB-1.210), John Molson Building (MB) (1450 Guy St.), Sir George Williams Campus.\nCheck out the wealth of resources and information carefully considered and compiled by the professional healthcare providers at Concordia's Health Services .\n \n"}

Prior to this he held his first post doctoral fellowship at the August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), where he also taught in the Department of Cell Biology. He received a PhD in Medical Physiology from Lund University (Sweden) and has a strong background in molecular biology and protein chemistry after studies at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund University (MSc., Chemical Engineering).\nEducation\nPhD (Lund University), MSc (Lund University)\nResearch interests\nThe main research interests in Dr Bergdahl’s lab lies in studies of the blood vessel wall with a focus on understanding this system during physiologically stressful situations like exercise as well as pathophysiological conditions. The differentiation and functional properties of smooth muscle cells depend on the cellular environment, and any disturbance of this, such as endothelial damage, inflammation or lipid retention will lead to reactions that can initiate atherosclerotic lesions. Dr Bergdahl study mechanisms involved in these processes by using state-of-the-art techniques including electrophysiology, isometric force measurements, functional proteomics, molecular genetics and advanced imaging. The overriding goal is to define conditions that are essential for the normal function and cell differentiation in the vascular wall and to translate these findings from the basic understanding and experimental animal research into clinical understanding of integrative cardiovascular control in health and disease. This is hoped to generate new therapeutic approaches which in the future might lead to better prevention of vascular disease.\nTeaching activities\n"}

Using neurophysiological techniques, students and myself aim to identify how the activity in the brain is coordinated, either in the basic rhythmicity or in a functional manner. We use recordings from many electrodes to describe brain waves and nerve cell activity. In the cerebellum specifically, it is not yet known how groups of cells interact to produce coordinated sensation and behavior. Techniques used in the lab focus on describing the underlying mechanisms shaping populations of neurons, using signals from many single units as well as field potentials in vivo in the awake or anesthetized animal.\nI study the neurophysiology of neuronal oscillations, centering on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.\nFunding\nAcademic Unit Head Research stipend\nCurrent lab members\nJustin Dionne, M.Sc. student in Exercise Science, 2013-now.\nProject: Developing a human posture paradigm as influenced by TENS.\nPublications\nFrederick A, Bourget-Murray J,  Chapman CA, Amir S, Courtemanche R (2014) Diurnal influences on electrophysiological oscillations and coupling in the dorsal striatum and cerebellar cortex of the anesthetized rat.

We are in the midst of a scientific revolution; major discoveries continue to be made that change the way we think about traditional scientific subjects. By using a combination of traditional and outside-the-box teaching methods I try to inspire students to learn not just for the sake of learning but because they are inspired by the material. My lectures aim to blend ‘textbook facts’ with new information. In this way the students will leave Concordia with a cutting edge knowledge base and way of thinking that will help them succeed in whatever endeavor they pursue.”\nCourses taught\nEXCI461 Pharmacology for Sport and Exercise\nEXCI257 Physiology (Endocrinology)\nResearch activities\nCurrent research projects\nOur research area is immunology, with an emphasis on how the immune system and autonomic nervous system communicate with each other. The main project called \"Hormonal regulation of T cell Genomics.\", is meant to investigate how the catecholamine hormone receptors (e.g. beta2-adrenergic receptor) influence T lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Other hormones of interest include thyroid hormones and cortisol. A second project called \"Human variations in sympathetic nervous system response.\" was recently launched to address the hypothesis that human autonomic traits are distributed around two theoretical groupings. For this project, human subjects listen to dissonant music or undergo cold exposure to induce autonomic reactions. A third initiative is in development to investigate the impact of sodium on T lymphocyte responses in people. Dr. Darlington always encourages students to develop and pursue their own research interests within the themes of immunology and autonomic nervous system. The research happens in Canada at the PERFORM Centre and the Center for Structural and Functional Genomics at the Loyola Campus in NDG, Montreal, Quebec. \nPublications\nSelected publications\n1.      A.

Chronic pain is a prevalent, disabling, and costly problem for our society.  Clinical outcomes following treatment of shoulder disorders are often unfavorable and, as a result, shoulder pain represents a significant source of chronic disability. My research attempts to determine the risk factors that lead to increased pain perception and decreased function in a variety of populations.\nResearch activities\nThe Athletic Therapy Research Laboratory\nThe focus of our lab is to evaluate the kinetic and kinematics variables in humans. We evaluate healthy subjects as well as injured patients undergoing treatment. We assess strength, range of motion, and performance in various populations. In addition we measure pain and psychological responses to pain and injury. Some of the equipment we currently use includes a Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer, algometry, and EMG analysis.\nPublications\nSelected publications\nGeorge SZ, Dover GC, Fillingim RB.

He was further promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 2006.\nEducation\nPhD (McGill University)\nResearch interests\nDr. Leroux's main research interest is primarily focused on rehabilitation of hemiparetic subjects secondary to stroke. His research findings have been very encouraging and have demonstrated that individuals who suffered a stroke can recuperate some of their physical functions through participation in community-based exercise programs. What is most remarkable about his findings are that these functional improvements have occurred years after these individuals stopped conventional rehabilitation treatments. Dr. Leroux's research future will look at the relation between physical exertion and postural stability in hemiparetic subjects due to stroke.\n"}

Initially, he taught two elective courses that were offered to Concordia University's general student population, namely: EXCI 233, Current Issues in Personal & Community Health, and EXCI 251, Fundamentals of Health & Physical Activity. Four years later, in 2004, he was accepted as an Extended Term Appointment (ETA), which allowed him to retain his status as a junior lecturer in the department.\nHenceforth, in the Fall 2004 semester, he began a new workload allowing him to teach four courses within the Department of Exercise Science.; These courses included: EXCI 200, Introduction to Exercise Science, Physical Activity & Health; EXCI 261, Physical Activity Programming For Health & Performance; EXCI 342, Fitness Assessment & Exercise Intervention; and EXCI 452, Essentials of Strength Training & Conditioning. One of his mandates was to uncover content overlap in these four courses and suggest replacement courses to the departmental curriculum committee (DPC).\nAs of the Fall 2007 semester, he will begin teaching one of these replacement courses, which is called EXCI 252, Introduction to Physical Activity, Health, and Fitness. The following year, he will be teaching EXCI 352, Essentials of Exercise Testing and Training in Athletic Populations, which replaces the EXCI 452 course. Finally, in 2009, he will teach EXCI 450, Physical Fitness Assessment, Exercise Prescription and Rehabilitation in Special Populations, which is primarily intended for students registered in the department's Clinical Exercise Physiology department.\nEducation\nBEd, MA, McGill University\nResearch interests\nPresently, Mr. Panenic is not involved in any kind of research because his main responsibility is to teach courses at the undergraduate level.\n"}

Despite existing public policy and individual weight interventions, we are still “growing” as a population with more Canadians overweight than not.\nThe metabolic and cellular mechanisms of why some overweight individuals develop diseases while others do not are not fully understood. Furthermore, in people with diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, we do not fully understand how obesity affects the progression or treatment. Obesity treatment itself remains ineffective as most people who lose weight eventually gain it back.\nThe goal of Dr. Santosa’s research program is to identify the long-term effects of obesity, from the cell to the entire body.
