Satisfying these needs by burning fossil fuels results in pollution, undesired climate changes and eventual exhaustion of the fuel reserves. Nuclear energy is not problem-free either. Renewable energy is likely to provide the solution for these challenges. Sun offers the most abundant potential source of energy and delivers 3,850,000x1018 J per year to Earth, compared to ~630 x1018 J per year currently consumed by the human civilization. Sun energy was supporting the life on Earth for billions of years via process of photosynthesis. (In fact, all existing fossil fuel reserves originate from photosynthesis processes of long ago.) As a result of evolution, proteins performing the first steps of photosynthesis achieved amazing effectiveness. Can we learn something useful from Nature by exploring how these first steps are organized? To this end, we explore energy and primary charge separation processes in isolated photosynthetic proteins.\n \n \nFigure 1. Left: Top view of plant Photosystem I. Blue: protein. Grey: chlorophylls. Yellow: carotenoids. Red: quinones, Orange: FeS clusters.\nRight: side view of the bacterial reaction center. Grey: bacteriochlorophylls. Dark-blue: bacteriopheophytines, Red: quinones, Orange: non-heme iron. Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for determining BRC structure in 1988 .\nProteins involved in photosynthesis can also serve as model systems in the studies of some very general protein features. Proteins perform wide variety of tasks in the living organisms. Their ability to perform the designated tasks depends critically on their tertiary structure, achieved as a result of folding. But how do proteins “know” how to fold properly? It is well known that they fold to minimize their free energy (including electrostatic and entropic terms). However, folding even a small protein by trial and error would take forever (Levinthal paradox). Thus, proteins are believed to possess funnel-like energy landscapes with multiple hierarchal tiers. These landscapes can be explored using optical spectroscopy. Proteins involved in photosynthesis have in-built fluorescent molecules (chlorophylls) that can serve as very sensitive probes to local protein environment. Optical spectroscopy also allows one to explore heat transport in proteins and through protein-water interfaces.\nPhotosynthetic reaction centers utilize light energy to transfer electrons through the (thylakoid or cell) membrane. A number of substances can inhibit this process. (The strongest of these substances are agricultural herbicides.) We have demonstrated inhibition of electron transfer in isolated photosynthetic reaction centers by explosives and are continuing to work on photosynthesis-based explosives biosensors.\nFigure 2. Relationship between single photosynthetic complex spectroscopy and spectral hole burning. The raster-scan image of the sample containing multiple complexes (of the same type, e.g. LH2) is in the center. One can select a single complex (left, one complex contains multiple chlorophyll molecules, hence multiple spectral lines, © Köhler’s Group, Bayreuth), or one can work with the whole ensemble (right) and select molecules in resonance with the narrow-band laser. Then a small conformational change of the environment may be triggered by light, shifting the absorption of these molecules.\nWe are capable of spectroscopic measurements on both single molecules and macroscopic samples. Mostly we employ so-called site-selective sub-ensemble spectroscopy techniques (non-photochemical spectral hole burning - in protein or amorphous solids context this involves small conformational changes triggered by light; fluorescence line narrowing, etc). We are also developing various software tools to model single-molecule and site-selective spectroscopy results. Currently we are working on bridging the size-scale gap and engaging in the studies of sub-micron biological samples utilizing Convex-Lens Induced Confinement technique (credit for inspiration to Sabrina Leslie of McGill). The distinguishing feature of our approach is taking CLIC to cryogenic temperatures. On the other hand, at room temperature CLIC cell can be used as tunable-size micro- or nano-fluidic cell for biosensor applications.\n Couple of years ago we started expanding our research to graphene and carbon nanotubes (in collaboration with Alexandre Champagne’s group). These systems exhibit a number of interesting optical/spectroscopic properties, particularly in quantum dot regime. Of special interest are simultaneous optical and electron transport measurements.\nResearch interests\nRenewable     energy: Optical spectroscopy of pigment-protein light-harvesting     photosynthetic complexes - energy transfer and charge transfer.\nBiophotonics / Protein     structure and [low-temperature] dynamics - Protein-chlorophyll complexes     as model systems.

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst.\nThorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes.\nWe are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions.\nThe biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution.\nWhy study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.\nRepresentative publications\nM. Dong,  A. Babalhavaeji,  M.

Christophe Grova is directing The Multimodal Functional Imaging Laboratory , a multidisciplinary team composed of neurologists and methodologists, investigating  multimodal data fusion to characterize brain mechanisms in healthy conditions and also during epileptic activity.\nBeing affiliated to both Biomedical Engineering and Neurology and Neurosurgery Departments at McGill University since July 2008, Dr. Grova investigates the integration of multimodal functional data to study brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic activity. His research project aims at combining multimodal data in order to detect additional information that could be missed by considering each modality individually. His project involves the integration of three promising functional modalities:\nSimultaneous ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) - MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) acquisitions, measuring directly on the scalp electric and magnetic components of epileptic signals generated by neurons synchronously active (at a ms scale). Source localization procedure is then required to localize the generators of these discharges within the brain.\nSimultaneous EEG - functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI acquisitions to measure, within the whole brain at a second scale, hemodynamic responses that correlate with epileptic discharges detected on scalp EEG.\nSimultaneous EEG - Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) acquisitions to measure local changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the time of epileptic discharges detected on scalp EEG, by exploiting absorption properties of infrared light within brain tissues using optic fibres placed on the surface of the head.\nThe comparison of EEG/fMRI and EEG/NIRS offers a unique way to address in vivo the question of the integrity of the neurovascular coupling in the epileptic brain. In addition of studying brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic discharges, Dr. Grova is currently applying similar methodologies to study resting state functional connectivity in epilepsy patients.\nIn July 2014, Christophe Grova became  an assistant Professor in the Physics Department and a researcher in the brand new multimodal imaging platform of the  PERFORM centre at Concordia University, while remaining an adjunct Professor in Biomedical Engineering Department and Neurology and Neurosurgery Department of McGill University . This new imaging platform of PERFORM is equipped with a 3T MRI, simultaneous SPECT/CT and PET/CT devices, TMS and high density MR compatible EEG. His research projects are about to evolve to incorporate these new modalities, in order to study epileptic activity, but also many other applications in neurosciences including healthy aging, exercise and multimodal analysis of resting state functional connectivity.\nSelected publications\nGiovanni Pellegrino, Tanguy Hedrich, Rasheda Chowdhury, Jeffery A Hall, Jean‐Marc Lina, Francois Dubeau, Eliane Kobayashi, Christophe Grova, “Source localization of the seizure onset zone from ictal EEG/MEG data” , Hum.

Thanks to the properties of photons (the virtual particles that carry light), photonics has the potential for creating faster and more power-efficient devices than electronics. One of the building blocks for photonic circuits is the optical micro-resonator, which keeps light confined in both space and time. Micro-resonators are the basis of many photonic devices, such as filters, modulators, delay lines, etc. We are interested in exploring optical micro-resonators with new geometries and materials for creating new micro- and nanophotonic devices.\nA hollow microtube is an optical microresonator. This particular one is made of InGaAsP, and has quantum dots embedded in its walls.\nMicrotubes also work as lasers. This data shows the lasing threshold (at 82 K)for the microtube pictured above.\nMicroresonator-based sensors\nThe optical characteristics of microresonators, in particular their resonant wavelengths, are very sensitive to changes in their environment. We can use this to make very sensitive optical sensors, which let us measure minute changes in refraction index, concentration, or even the presence of nanoparticles, viruses, or bacteria.\nSchematic representation of how a microresonator sensor works.\n"}

Misra received his Ph. D. degree in Physics from St. Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA in the area of condensed matter physics. He did his post-doctoral work at the University of Toronto. His current research interests are in both theoretical and experimental EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance, also known as ESR, electron spin resonance). His research laboratory includes X-band (~9.5 GHz) and Q-band (~35 GHz) CW (continuous wave) EPR spectrometers, operational in the 4.2 – 1000 K temperature range.\nHe collaborates actively with researchers at ACERT (Advanced Center for Electron Spin Resonance Technology) at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, whose director is Professor Jack Freed, as a collaborating faculty member from Canada. Apart from single-crystal and polycrystalline CW EPR research using the 170 and 240 GHz at ACERT, he does simulations for rigorous computations of signals obtained (i) by DQC (double quantum coherence) pulsed EPR to measure distances in membranes, and (ii) by 2D-ELDOR (two dimensional electron double resonance) pulsed EPR to measure distances in biological samples at ambient temperatures.\nHis other involvement is in optimizing the coil gradients used in the EPR imaging being developed at ACERT. He is also carrying out EPR research in nano-materials and high-Tc superconductors. He has also been involved in electron spin-lattice relaxation studies, with the latest research being on exploitation of amplitude-modulation technique in measuring very short spin-lattice (T1) and electron-electron (T2) relaxation times, in the range of one-tenth nano-second to one micro-second. Nine Ph. D. and ten Master?s students have received their degrees under his supervision\nHe has served as an external examiner to several Ph. D. theses examinations outside of Concordia University, submitted in Canada, France, and Australia. He serves as a referee to important journals in Physics and Chemistry which publish EPR research, e.g. the Physical Review and Physical Review Letters, Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, Journal of Chemical Physics, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Magnetism and magnetic Materials, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Journal of Applied Magnetic Resonance. He has published several review articles in EPR, as well as he has written book chapters in leading research monographs. His research has been continuously supported by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada).

Kalman Research Group\nIn traditional lecture courses as well as courses that use interactive engagement, students are less expert-like at the end of the course than they were at the beginning (Madsen, McKagan, & Sayre, 2015). Our recent research was based on the hypothesis that students' epistemological beliefs could become more expert-like with a combination of appropriate instructional activities: (a) pre-class reading with metacognitive reflection (Kalman, 2011), and (b) in-class active learning that produces cognitive dissonance (Kalman et al. 2015).\n \nGroup members\nOur research group has been designing many new pedagogical approaches for a long time (e.g., Kalman et al., 1999; Kalman, Rohar, & Wells, 2004; Kalman et al., 2008; Kalman, Sobhanzadeh, Thompson, Ibrahim, & Wang, 2015) to help students succeed in their courses (e.g., Kalman & Rohar, 2010; Kalman, Milner-Bolotin, & Antimirova, 2010; Khanam & Kalman, 2016). Our focus has now gone beyond the question of whether or not a pedagogical technique is effective, toward a more intense focus on finding a class of techniques that is effective in helping students become more like expert thinkers. Contrary to the normal experience noted above (Madsen, McKagan, & Sayre, 2015) we have shown in our recent work that it is possible to help students make progress toward “expert-learning style.”\n \nNorah Alodiby, MSc \nRecent theses\n\"Reflective writing for a better understanding of concepts of scientific concepts in high school\", J.

We also want to use these sensors as laboratories to explore the physics of carbon nanotube and graphene quantum dots.\nCartoon of electron transport in a quantum dot nano-oscillators\nTopological Insulators\n3D Topological insulators are a family of materials with a band gap but which have an odd number of 2D conducting surface states that cross the band gap at the boundaries of the crystal (See Figure). The word topological refers to the fact that they differ from regular insulators not because of a spontaneously broken symmetry but because of a topological order parameter which is invariant and can only be change if the system undergoes a quantum phase transition.\nWe make electron transport measurements in micron scale 3D topological insulators (TI) to explore the physics of their surface states and the exotic correlated states that they can form when a band gap (mass term) in introduced in their dispersion.

We study individual Si-NWs grown by the VLS method (Moutanabbir), see Figure, with ordered lattice defect planes along the growth direction. Characterization of the Si-NWs is done by micro-Raman spectroscopy which is sensitive to the presence of crystal faults. Transport and magneto-transport measurements are done at low temperature in single suspended Si-NWs transistors. We are interested in exploring fundamental quantum transport in Si-NW quantum dots, as well as their application in thermal energy harvesting. The thermal conductivity, K, of Si-NWs is lower than for bulk silicon. Defect and surface engineering of Si-NWs can further reduce K, improving the thermoelectric efficiency (ability to harvest energy) to maximizing the figure of merit ZT = (S^2)*sigma*T/K. This would have applications in industry such as improving thermocouples to gather more thermal energy from vapor exhausts.\nLeft panel, high-resolution TEM image of a Si-NW crystal’s structure showing stacking faults along the growth direction.

The nano-crystal size distributions have been characterised using dark field mode X-TEM and are well described by a lognormal probability density function which provides characteristic values for the mean size,L and the standard deviation,σ . Under nonresonant (473 nm) pumping, the photoluminescence (PL) transients associated with the Er3+ first excited (4/13/2) to ground state (4/15/2) transition (1534 nm) reveal a multiexponential character indicative of the local environment of the emitting centres. A detailed analysis of the decay transients reveals two distinct classes of luminescent erbium; one of these populations, at a distance on the order of a bond length (~0.3 nm) from the nano-crystal interface, exhibits a relatively short radiative lifetime (between 3 and 5 ms) dependent on the size of the neighbouring nano-crystal. Calculations reveal that this may be attributed to a Purcell-like enhancement of the radiative rate induced by local changes in the refractive index for the Er close to a spherical dielectric interface. The second population, which exhibits a much longer lifetime (between 10 and 15 ms), is characteristic of that of Er in a stoichiometric SiO2 host. The presence of a fast component (between 500 and 800 μs) in all of the transients is attributed to non-radiative ion-ion interactions as a result of the formation of Er/Er-O clusters. These results may have implications for the design of future waveguide optical amplifiers.\nDr. Iain F. Crowe \nNovember 27, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nMeasuring heat at the nanoscale\nA quantity seldomly measured during nanoscale processes is the heat released or required by a process, and yet it gives key information about these processes because it measures directly how the energy of the system evolves. Much like differential scanning calorimetry, nanocalorimetry is a technique where very thin layers are deposited on a membrane and are scanned in temperature, here at up to 1 million degrees per second, transforming small amounts of heat into measurable power. The technique can be applied in situ, avoiding exposition to ambient or starting at low temperature. In this presentation, we will review some of the application of the technique, from measuring melting point and Curie temperature depression in nanostructures to the relaxation in amorphous silicon, to solid-state reactions in ultra-thin films.\nDr. François Schiettekatte \nNovember 20, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nCoherent spintronics with electron and nuclear spins in nanostructures\nI will review some of the recent efforts (both experimental and theoretical) to gain full control over the coherent dynamics of spins in semiconductor nanostructures (quantum dots, wires, and wells). A serious challenge to these studies is to derive a microscopic Hamiltonian that accurately describes these many-spin systems and to predict the relevant dynamics. I will also review some potential applications of these studies, including the implementation of ideas from quantum information science.\nDr. Bill Coish, \nNovember 13, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nWhispering gallery mode resonators: from light propagation to biosensing\nLabel-free microsphere resonators were shown to be sensitive optical biosensors thanks to the very high quality factor up to Q~10^9 of their whispering gallery modes (WGMs). The spectral shift of a single mode of a single microsphere is the most common detection signal, but several resonances are available to probe the analyte frequency response in polarizability. However, the full spectrum of WGMs for an elliptical resonator is complicated, warranting further measures and optimizations of light propagation in this system. On one hand, our high resolution interferometric studies of the microsphere with a dual frequency comb provide both its impulse response in the time domain with 400 fs resolution and its transmission spectrum in the frequency domain with picometer resolution. In the former case, light pulses are periodically outcoupling from a ~73 mm microsphere after each round trip of ~1.13 ps with a phase delay depending on the refractive index of the surrounding medium. On the other hand, simpler WGM spectra are obtained with smaller ~10 mm fluorescent microspheres having a lower Q~2000, which are commercially available. These microspheres are then used in a more practical flow-cytometer based biosensing system making a compromise between sensitivity, sturdiness and ease of use.\nDr. Claudine Allen, \nNovember 6, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nQuantum transport in 10 nanometer-scale suspended graphene devices\nWe study coherent electron transport in suspended ultra-short graphene devices ranging from 10 to 100 nm in length. We developed a feedback-controlled electromigration method to fabricate these ultra-short suspended graphene devices. This customized method makes it possible to fabricate damage-free devices or introduce defects in a controlled way. Depending on their width, our devices show quantum dot (QD) behavior or ballistic (scattering-free) transport. We measure ballistic conductivity and Fabry-Prot interferences as a function of charge density in our devices. The data is in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the ballistic transport of Dirac (relativistic) fermions. The coherence length extracted from the Fabry-Prot oscillations is much longer than the length of our devices. We argue that this indicates ballistic transport in the source and drain electrodes (made of graphene capped with a gold film) connecting our suspended graphene transistors. This work sets up the stage to study the strain-engineering of electron transport in graphene, and provides essential information for the development of graphene nanoelectronics.\nVahid Tayari, \nOctober 30, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nSeeing Atoms in 3D\nHarnessing nanoscale and quantum phenomena in semiconductors creates valuable opportunities to achieve novel or superior functionalities with actual or potential impacts on nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, carbon-free energy conversion, and bio-integrated technologies. A precise probe of the structure and composition of semiconductor nanostructures is of paramount importance to understand the basic properties on the nanoscale of these highly attractive systems. Developing this body of knowledge is a crucial step to implement the emerging nanotechnologies and control their performance. In this presentation, we will describe the use of laser-assisted atom probe tomography to achieve tri-dimensional atom-by-atom mapping of single semiconductor nanostructures. The successful application of this technique enables a precise and rigorous analysis of the composition of a nanostructure and provides unprecedented insights into its internal structure. Examples including metal-catalyzed nanowires, nanomembranes, and superlattices will be presented and discussed.\nDr. Oussama Moutanabbir, \nOctober 23, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectron shot noise is quantum light\nElectrons in conductors have a disordered motion, a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"noise\". In classical physics, this noise (more precisely, the variance of current fluctuations) is proportional to the temperature and the conductance of the conductor. When we consider a tiny device placed at very low temperature, things change: one can no longer consider the electrons as classical particles, but quantum mechanics dictates their behavior. We will describe some concepts and experiments related to quantum noise in conductors. In particular we will show very recent experiments in which we observe that the noise emitted by such a conductor may consist of correlated photons and that it can be squeezed just like light in quantum optics.\nDr. Bertrand Reulet, \nOctober 16, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nGuiding axons and cells with laser engineering\nThe wiring of the nervous system during development is an autonomous process that creates a circuit several orders of magnitude more complex than the most sophisticated microchip ever produced. The formation of this overwhelmingly complex structure is ultimately governed by stochastic molecular interactions that repeatedly yield the same electrical design. Thus, understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance remains a challenging biological problem with remarkable clinical implications. We will describe new microfabrication strategies to reproduce protein gradients for studying axonal guidance in vitro. Lasers can be used to engineer artificial environments where the different chemical components mediating neuronal pathfinding can be precisely controlled to fabricate highly elaborate patterns. We will see how we can exploit this new method for elucidating the precise manner in which cells interpret the spatial distribution of chemical indicators.\nDr. Santiago Costantino \nMaisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Centre, Université de Montréal\nOctober 9, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectricity & Magnetism: Advances in Space Physics From Particles Motion to Nonlinear Waves\nSince the 1950s when space exploration began, Electricity & Magnetism has developed to a new stage. Electric (E) and magnetic (M) fields have been measured in different spatial scales of our electric universe. Based on observations, we demonstrate the characteristics of the motion of the charged particles driven by E&M fields, and the resultant non-Maxwellian distributions in velocity space. These particles produce nonlinear waves which are either simple-wave solitons or amplitude-modulated oscillatory solitons (called oscillitons). By making use of the fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism, a new space technology, electric tether propulsion for interplanetary exploration, attracts worldwide research and development.\nDr. Zhen Guo (John) Ma \nConcordia University\nOctober 2, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nQuantum Matter \"On-a-chip\"!\nQuantum physical phenomena are inherently different in dimensions lower than 3D. For instance, one can observe bizarre electronic quantum states in 2D with the properties of charge fractionalization, and in even lower dimension (1D) one can observe the conductance of a wire to be given by a single quantum corresponding to G=2e^2/h.\nIn this talk, I will describe a few low temperature experiment, all performed on some sort of a \"chip\", with the hope to elucidate bizarre quantum phenomena. These include our effort to detect bizarre particles that are neither boson or fermion, in 2D the 1D-1D Coulomb drag of electrons in two closed-pack quantum wires, separated by only ~15 nm, a nano-engineered quantum faucet (for real fluids!). It's a lot of (quantum) fun!\nDr. Guillaume Gervais \nSeptember 25, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nSome new applications of gauge/gravity duality\nIn this talk I'll briefly summarize the status of gauge/gravity duality and discuss some new applications of this duality to solve large N QCD and other related problems.\nDr. Keshav Dasgupta \nSeptember 18, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nAtomic-size semiconductor nanostructures\nShrinking semiconductor nanostructures to the size of a small molecule or a single atom would offer many interesting advantages: they would provide the uniformity and predictability of atomic defects, they would exhibit the high symmetry necessary for a number of promising applications, and they could confine charge carriers to a volume of atomic dimension, thereby reaching the ultimate limit of device integration.\nIn this presentation, I will describe our work on isoelectronic traps and how these nanostructures can bind excitons. Then, I will present our latest results on nitrogen, tellurium and beryllium molecules embedded in semiconductors. We find that these molecules can bind various charged configurations: negatively and positively charged excitons and biexcitons. Finally, using the bound exciton to define a two-level system, I will show that we can achieve complete coherent control over this qubit using a series of optical pulses.\nDr. Sébastien Francoeur \nDepartment of Engineering Physics, École Polytechnique de Montréal\nSeptember 11, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nOptical micro resonators: highly sensitive sensors and versatile filters\nOptical Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (OMEMS) attracted a lot of interest over the last decade. Several novel devices and products emerged from this technology in particular in telecommunication (e.g. optical fiber switches, projection displays, etc.). Today, the applications of these microsystems spread over a wide area ranging from astronomy to biology. Beyond the conventional engineered devices and products, optical MEMS are actually nothing else than a toolbox, which enables novel investigations of scientific phenomena at the nanoscale. In this context, my research activity focuses on tuning the optical properties of nanostructures using Micro Electro Mechanical Systems for applications in astronomy, telecommunications, aerospace, biology and medicine.\nDuring the seminar I will give an overview of our projects exploiting this new avenue (sensors and tunable devices based on photonic crystals and different types of optical resonators). Tunable in-plane Fabry-P rot cavities integrated on chip will be specifically highlighted through several different applications.\nDr. Yves-Alain Peter \nDepartment of Engineering Physics, École Polytechnique de Montréal\nSeptember 9, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room CC 305\nInvestigation of metastability effects in hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon thin films by the steady-state measurement methods\nUpon exposure of microcrystalline silicon (c-Si:H) thin films to room ambient, water vapour, di-onized water, or to different gas atmospheres, these materials frequently show metastability changes of their electronic properties. These changes are generally detected by using the techniques probing the properties of sample at the steady-state condition. Even though the first published results appeared at the beginning of 1980s by Veprek et al., more extensive investigation has been carried out in the last decade by using the steady-state measurements. In most studies, very thin samples deposited on smooth glass substrate were used in measurements due to adhesion problems of thicker samples on the smooth glass substrates. It was reported that conductivities in some materials increased and in others they decreased in the metastable state significantly, showing no clear functional dependence on the crystallinity of the material. These changes were reported to be reversible after heat treatment in short period after deposition and irreversible for longer periods of a few years. Such changes were mainly attributed to the band bending at the surface of the film, within cracks or at the grain boundaries.\nIn this study, we have developed new standard measurement procedures and applied to investigate the metastability phenomena using temperature dependent dark conductivity, steady-state photoconductivity (SSPC), sub-bandgap absorption spectroscopy as detected by dual beam photoconductivity (DBP) and steady-state photocarrier grating (SSPG) methods for c-Si:H thin films with a wide range of structure compositions. c-Si:H films were deposited using VHF-PECVD at 200C on both smooth and rough glass substrates. The microstructure of the films was changed from amorphous (a-Si:H) to highly crystalline by adjusting the process gas silane concentration during deposition. The crystallinity was evaluated from Raman measurements. Thickness of the samples varies between 200 nm and 1100 nm. Silver coplanar electrodes were evaporated on the samples with 0.5 cm length and 0.5 mm separation. The samples were randomly exposed to atmospheric gases by keeping them in the dark laboratory atmosphere. In addition, a controlled gas treatment was performed in high vacuum cryostat. Annealing was carried out at 430K in high vacuum. All probe measurements were performed at 300K as sample is at the steady-state condition. Metastable changes in dark conductivity due to Fermi level shifts and in majority carrier electron mobility-lifetime products, μn τn, determined from the SSPC measurements were correlated with those in the minority carrier hole mobility-lifetime products, μp τp , obtained from the SSPG measurements. In addition, sub-bandgap absorption coefficient spectra of the samples at the same treated states were carefully measured in order to see the changes in the density of occupied defect states in the bandgap of the microcrystalline silicon which affects both electron and hole transport properties. The results obtained in this study were discussed with those published in the literature on the metastability phenomena of microcrystalline silicon films.\nDr. Mehmet Günes \nMugla Sitki Kocman University, Turkey\nSeptember 4, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nEffects of distribution of excitation energy transfer times and protein dynamics on spectral hole burning in pigment-protein complexes involved in photosynthesis\nUnderstanding the spectral properties of natural photosynthetic complexes is important to advance the design of the artificial photosynthetic systems. Traditionally the spectral properties of natural photosynthetic complexes are explored by either time-domain or frequency-domain high-resolution spectroscopy methods, including non-photochemical spectral hole burning (NPHB).\nThe main goal of this research was the study of various effects of the distribution of excitation energy transfer times and protein dynamics on non-photochemical hole burning processes in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes. In the first part of this seminar we present our results concerning the inclusion of the distributions of excitation energy transfer (EET) rates (homogeneous line widths) and charge separation rates into treatment of the resonant and non-resonant NPHB processes in photosynthetic chlorophyll-protein complexes. The effects of the line width distributions resulting from Frster-type EET on the resonant NPHB process have been explored both theoretically and experimentally in isolated CP43 antenna from spinach. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that inclusion of the effects of frequency-dependent EET rate distributions and burning following EET on the treatment of non-resonant NPHB spectra of trimeric Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein from Cb. Tepidum leads to reasonable agreement between the theoretical and experimental data. Charge separation rate distributions were explored in PSII RC.\nThe second part of this presentation is focused on the analysis of HB spectral properties of the lowest energy states of Photosystem I (PSI) with the aims to gain better understanding of particular structural origins of these states as well as on the protein dynamics of PSI.\nNicoleta Herascu \nAugust 28, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nUltra-Short Carbon Nanotube Quantum Dot Transistors: Electron-Hole Asymmetry, Bending Vibrons, and the Kondo Effect\nUsing an electromigration procedure which we recently developed, we generate 10 nm-scale single-wall carbon nanotube quantum dot (SWCNT QD) transistors. Because these devices are so short, we can observe fundamental mesoscopic physics which has not yet been explored, and engineer tuneable nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and ultra-short transistors.\nContrary to what has been observed in longer SWCNT devices, we observe strong electron-hole asymmetry in charge transport, due to charge doping from the metallic leads. This asymmetry manifests itself as a striking difference between electron and hole conductance regimes (0D to 1D transport), and in the charging energy of our QDs (up to a factor of 3). The magnitude of the asymmetry depends on the bandgap and length of the SWCNT.\nSuspended SWCNTs can strongly couple to their electrostatic environment through the bending mode, and act as NEMS sensors. Shorter NEMS have higher frequencies and therefore higher sensitivity. By creating very short devices, we observe bending mode frequencies up to ≈ 280 GHz, and tune this frequency by electrostatic strain. We clearly resolve the first and second harmonic of the bending mode and extract their effective coupling to be γ eff ~ 103\nIn high conductance devices, we observe a strong Kondo effect, with Kondo temperatures up to TK ≈ 28 K. In devices combining Kondo and the bending mode, we measure a large reduction in charging energy, to the point of complete suppression. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that charging energy renormalization has been observed in SWCNTs.\nAndrew McRae \nAugust 20, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nModeling and Characterization of Protein Energy Landscapes at Low Temperatures using Hole Burning Spectroscopy\nProteins are playing various important roles in living organisms. Understanding the way they can perform different tasks is a demanding goal for scientists. Some flexibility is essential for proper functioning of proteins, and knowledge about both static structures and dynamics is essential for understanding them. One of the tools for studying proteins is optical spectroscopy. However, proteins are almost incapable of light absorption in the visible range which makes them non reachable for direct measurements; therefore, indirect methods should be applied. Pigment embedded into (amorphous) solid can serve as a local reporter on static and dynamic properties of its environment. Using proteins with pigments embedded into them by Nature offers a good alternative to introducing local reporters by chemical or genetic manipulations. In our study we focus on pigment-protein complexes involved in photosynthesis. In the first half we report several improvements to techniques of measuring the parameters of proteins energy landscapes. We prove that tunneling is responsible for both thermally- and light-induced spectral diffusion in photosynthetic proteins at low temperatures, that distributions of barriers on the protein energy landscape are likely Gaussian as well as make some suggestions concerning entities involved in tunneling. The reasoning by which we arrive to Gaussian barrier distributions is not specific to proteins, which results in us questioning some theories of glasses and other amorphous solids at low temperatures, and the quality of measurements supporting these theories. In the second half we introduce new approach to modeling spectral diffusion, which includes the light-induced one. Modeling results appear to be in reasonable agreement with the experiment. Importantly, we demonstrate that samples used in spectroscopy experiments on proteins must be fairly far from thermodynamic equilibrium.\nMehdi Najafi \nAugust 14, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectronic transport in low dimensional systems\nRecent technological advancements have made it possible to fabricate electronic systems smaller and smaller, and as the dimensions of electronic components become comparable to quantum length scales the electronic transport properties are changed significantly. In the last few decades there has been intensive study on low dimensional electronic systems to explore new candidates for micro- and nanoelectronics to have future electronic devices that are faster, smaller, and have a range of new capabilities not possible with current technology. In this talk we present a review on the effects of electron confinement on systems such as quantum dots, quantum wires and quantum wells with examples of cutting edge fabricated devices. Different electronic transport regimes and quantum length scales will be discussed and we summarize the electronic transport of low dimensional systems including the reported data on GaAs/AlGaAs interfaces, carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets and Topological Insulator crystals.\nVahid Tayari \nMay 24, 2013 -- 1 pm -- Room CC 101\nHigh Resolution Spectroscopy\nHigh resolution spectroscopy methods are novel tools that enable one to uncover a narrow, homogeneous spectral line from an inhomogeneous broadened spectrum at low temperatures. In this seminar fundamentals of absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation as well as basics of optical spectra will be presented. Several interesting examples of single molecule spectroscopy in physics and life sciences will be included.\nNicoleta Herascu \nApril 10, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room CC 101\nQuantum ballistic conduction through quasi-one-dimensional wires\nPhase-coherent electron transport through quasi-one-dimensional systems has developed into a very active and fascinating subfield of mesoscopic physics. We present a review of this development focusing on ballistic conduction through quantum wires (or constrictions). In quantum wires the electron conductance versus Fermi energy is quantized as a consequence of the reduced dimensionality and the subsequent quantization of transverse momentum. The presence of scatterers in otherwise clean wires can strongly suppress the quantum conductance, and can generate sharp resonances (which are due to quasibound states) if the scattering potential is attractive. These resonances can be either Fano or Breit-Wigner type, depending on the size and/or strength of the scattering potential. Finite temperature effects are also considered. In the ballistic limit we present the derivation of the Landauer formula, which is the basic tool for calculating the conductance of a mesoscopic sample. Scattering in ballistic quantum wires is formulated in terms of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The Feshbach coupled-channel theory is employed in order to treat Fano resonances.\nDr. Vassilios Vargiamidis \nApril 3, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nViruses as Building Blocks for Materials and Devices\nSignificant challenges exist in assembling the building blocks of a nanoscale device. Self-assembly is one of the few practical strategies for making ensembles of nanostructures and will therefore be an essential part of nanotechnology. In order to generate complex structures through self-assembly, it is essential to develop methods by which different components in solution can come together in an ordered fashion. As biological interactions are better understood, there has been interest in using the specificity and strong interactions present in biology to organize and orient inorganic components to create new materials. Using viruses as nanoscale scaffolds for materials and devices offers the promise of exquisite control over positioning nanoscale components on a protein scaffold that also allows further self-assembly of the resulting constructs. I will discuss the successful use of viruses both as scaffolds for nanoscale devices such as electronic nanosensors as well as to produce optically active plasmonic components.\nDr. Amy Szuchmacher Blum \nMarch 27, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room CC 116\nNano-scale confinement enables new kinds of biophysical measurements\nA wide range of physiological processes rely on weak intermolecular interactions that occur at high concentrations, or over long time periods. Probing such interactions presents a challenge to fluorescence microscopy, the work horse for resolving biological processes at the molecular scale. To address this challenge, we develop new microscopy methodologies which, by imposing nano-scale confinement, enable new biophysical measurements under previously inaccessible conditions. We report on two biophysical experiments which apply these technologies. First, we perform precision spectroscopy on the behaviour of DNA under nano-scale confinement. We employ tuneable imaging chambers which combine gentle and localized (lithography-based) confinement, yielding new approaches to controlling and aligning DNA for optical interrogation. Second, we image the procession of myosin motor proteins in nano-scale chambers, motivated by measuring the chemo-mechanocoupling between ATP-uptake and motor procession along actin tracks, with enhanced background suppression.\nDr. Sabrina Leslie \nMarch 21, 2013 -- 2 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nQuantum Information Science and Technology: when tiny things do big things\nTwo landmark theories that emerged in the 20th century forever changed our world: quantum mechanics and information theory. The first altered our perception of reality; the second enabled the information age of today. Quantum Information Science and Technology bridge these theories by probing deep questions about information and reality, and by developing the transformative technologies of tomorrow. This talk will overview the basic concepts of Quantum Information Science and Technology and its applications to computing, communication and sensing. The current state of itsphysical realization using nuclear and electronic spins, photons, superconductor and semiconductors will also be explored.\nDr. Martin Laforest \nMarch 20, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nStrategies for Controlled Assembly at the Nanoscale\nThe bottomup approach is considered a potential alternative for low cost manufacturing of nanostructured materials. It is based on the concept of selfassembly of nanostructures on a substrate, and is emerging as an alternative paradigm for traditional top down fabrication used in the semiconductor industry.\nWe demonstrate various strategies to control nanostructure assembly (both organic and inorganic) at the nanoscale. Depending on the specific material system under investigation, we developed various approaches, which include, in particular: (i) deposition on naturally patterned substrates, which exploit longrange reconstructions that can be used to control the adsorption of organic molecules; (ii) we can control the size and luminescence properties of semiconductor nanostructures, synthesized by reactive laser ablation; (iii) we developed new experimental tools and comparison with simulations are presented to gain atomic scale insight into the surface processes that govern nucleation, growth and assembly; (iv) by controlling inter-molecular interactions, we create specific nanoscale patterns including guest/host architectures; (v) we developed a simple surface modification strategy for biomaterials which enhances biocompatibility; (vi) we devised new strategies for synthesizing multifunctional nanoscale materials to be used for electronics, photovoltaics and catalysis.\nExploiting surface cues, surface mediated interactions, intermolecular forces and moleculesurface interactions we demonstrated the formation of long range ordered patterns in a variety of nanoscale systems, which are potentially interesting for a variety of applications in electronics, biomedicine and energy.\nDr. Federico Rosei \nMarch 13, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nMapping molecular interactions and transport in cells with image correlation spectroscopy & fluorescence fluctuation analysis\nImage correlation methods provide a new window of analysis for measurement of protein-protein interactions and macromolecular transport properties from fluorescence images of living cells. These approaches are based on space and time correlation analysis of fluctuations in fluorescence intensity within images recorded as a time series on a laser scanning or total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. We recently introduced spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) which measures vectors of protein flux in cells based on the calculation of a spatial correlation function as a function of time from an image time series. Here we will describe the application of STICS and its two color extension, spatio-temporal image cross-correlation spectroscopy (STICCS), for measuring transport maps of adhesion related macromolecules such as integrin, alpha-actinin, paxillin, talin, and vinculin within, or associated with the basal membrane in living fibroblast and CHO cells. These measurements have allowed us to propose a model for the molecular clutch that regulates connections between the extracellular matrix, integrins in the membrane and the cytoskeleton during cell protrusion and migration\nWe will also illustrate the mapping of cytoskeletal dynamics within the growth cones of migrating neurons using STICS. Finally we will also highlight recent advances we have made with a new form of reciprocal (k-) space ICS, called kICS, that allows us to measure unbiased transport coefficients of fluorescently labeled membrane proteins even if there is complex photophysics (such as nanoparticle emission blinking) of the probe.\nWe will describe kICS measurements of the transport properties of quantum dot labeled receptors in the cell membrane as well as determination of clustering properties of QD labeled receptors based on kICS correlation studies of changes in the nanoparticle blinking.\nDr. Paul W. Wiseman \nMarch 6, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nResearch in Quantum Nonlinear Optics\nNonlinear optics is a venerable branch of photonics and optical physics, dating back certainly to 1961 or even earlier. Nonetheless, the field of nonlinear optics has recently experienced a renaissance by means of its application to problems in quantum information science and quantum optics. In this talk, I first present a very rapid overview of the development of the field of nonlinear optics and then move on the survey some areas of recent research interest.\nOne such example is research in slow and fast light. Research performed over the past several years has demonstrated new methods for controlling the velocity of propagation of light pulses through material systems. Ultra slow velocities (tens of meters per second) and ultrafast velocities (including negative velocities) have been demonstrated. This talk will present an overview of the field of slow and fast light and will include a discussion of some new ideas for applications of fast and slow light based on the use of room temperature solids.\nAnother topic of great current interest is that of quantum imaging. Image formation making use of quantum states of light allow dramatic new possibilities in the field of image science. We review some of the conceptual possibilities afforded by quantum imaging and describe some recent work that displays some of these features. In addition, we present some new experimental results on the role of coherence and indistinguishability in determining the properties of two-photon interference.\nDr. Robert W. Boyd \nUniversity of Ottawa & University of Rochester\nFebruary 27, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectrolyte gating as a platform to control the conductivity of nanostructured thin films\nElectrolyte gating relies on the use of electrolytes as gating media to modulate the conductivity of semiconducting thin films.\nThe principle of electrolyte gating is known since almost 60 years, having been used in the early works of Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain. Electrolyte-gated transistors consist of source and drain electrodes and a channel containing the semiconducting material in ionic contact with a gate electrode via an electrolyte solution, which replaces the gate dielectric used in more usual field-effect transistor structure. In electrolyte-gated organic transistors the application of a gate voltage induces the formation of an electrical double layer (EDL) at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface. EDL capacitances per unit areas are in the order of 10 μFcm-2 and can be as high as 500 μFcm-2, whereas the typical capacitance of a 200 nm-thick SiO2 dielectric is of the order of tens of nFcm-2.\nElectrolyte gating is used to fabricate transistors operating at low voltage (below 1 V) as an alternative to other approaches such the use of high-k, or ultrathin gate dielectrics.\nDespite the tremendous progress in the field, the physics behind the electrolyte gating phenomenon, in particular the specific effect of a certain ionic liquid on the conductivity modulation, is largely undiscovered.\nHere we report on electrolyte-gated transistors based on organic (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene, MEH-PPV, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM) and inorganic (ZnO, WO3) solution-processed thin films and making use, as the electrolyte, of different ionic liquids (BMIM-PF6, BMIM-TFSI, EMIM-TFSI). A tentative correlation between the effectiveness of the gating and the conductivity, viscosity, and ion size of the ionic liquids is proposed.\nDr. Clara Santato \nFebruary 19, 2013 -- 10:00 am -- Room SP 365.01\nMixed Plasmonic Nanoparticles for Enhanced-Performance Organic Solar Cells\nPhotovoltaics (PVs) are considered as a promising approach to provide renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources. Ease of process, low-cost, light-weight, optical tenability, recyclability and mechanical flexibility makes organic solar cells (OSCs) a competitive choice in comparison with the currently dominating inorganic polycrystalline and Si-based devices. To commercialize the polymer PVs, however, higher efficiencies are required. One recent approach is the incorporation of noble-metal nanoparticles (MNPs) in OSCs which could significantly contribute to the performance of the devices through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. The characteristics of plasmonic modes could be adjusted by tuning the shape and/or size of the incorporated MNPs in order to maximize the light harvesting efficiency of photoactive material.\nThe current work presents efficiency-enhanced OSCs using either gold nanorods (Au NRs), silver nanospheres (Ag NSs) or a dual plasmonic nanostructure consisting of Au NRs mixed with Ag NSs. In this method, each MNP contributes to the photocurrent and efficiency of OSCs depending on its size, shape and absorption spectra. A comparative study has been made between the characteristics of plasmonic devices by taking advantage of various characterization techniques. The similarity and differences of the results were investigated and the effects of integrating each type of MNPs on the overall electrical and optical performance of OSCs were discussed in detail. A remarkable increase of 30% in power conversion efficiency of plasmonic OSCs could be achieved using a mixture of Au NRs and Ag NSs.\nNeda Etebari Alamdari \nPOSTPONED UNTIL A LATER DATE\nQuantum Matter \"On-a-chip\"!\nQuantum physical phenomena are inherently different in dimensions lower than 3D. For instance, one can observe bizarre electronic quantum states in 2D with the properties of charge fractionalization, and in even lower dimension (1D) one can observe the conductance of a wire to be given by a single quantum corresponding to G=2e^2/h.\nIn this talk,I will describe a few low temperature experiments, all performed on some sort of a \"chip\", with the hope to elucidate bizarre quantum phenomena. These include:\nour effort to detect bizarre particles that are neither boson or fermion, in 2D\nthe 1D-1D Coulomb drag of electrons in two closed-pack quantum wires, separated by only ~15 nm,\na nano-engineered quantum faucet (for real fluids!) and\nan extreme microscope that can take pretty pictures in 16 tesla and at a temperature of 100 mK.\nIt's a lot of (quantum) fun!\nDr. Guillaume Gervais \nJanuary 23, 2013 -- 3:00 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nExploring nature's smallest scale using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider\nOne hundred years after the Bohr model of the atom and the publication of Millikan's seminal paper on the determination of the charge of an electron, the question of what matter is made of remains one of the leading science question. A significant research breakthrough occurred in 2012 with the discovery of the existence of a new particle, with a mass approximately 250,000 times heavier than an electron. Preliminary studies indicate that this new particle exhibits properties similar to those expected from the long-sought Higgs boson. This talk will describe how this new particle was discovered using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and prospects for detailed measurements of its properties.\nDr. Brigitte Vachon \nJanuary 16, 2013 -- 3:00 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nImaging, spectroscopy and manipulation by Atomic Force Microscopy\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a technique that allows atomic scale spatial resolution on essentially any material, including insulators and metals, in essentially any environment ranging from ultra high vacuum to liquids, at temperatures of several 100K down to mK. Many properties, such as electrical surface potential, mechanical stress, adhesion or friction can be measured at the same length scale, often as a function of external parameters such as light or electrochemical potential. Completing this 'nanolab' is the capability of AFM to manipulate objects. In this presentation I will explore several examples from research in my group to illustrate these capabilities. I will concentrate on three topics:\n1. We have used Ultra High Vacuum AFM integrated in a surface science system to understand and control the nucleation and growth of molecules on insulating surfaces. We can generate different molecular packing structures by suitable templating of the insulating substrates. This then allows us to correlate optical properties with structure using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, including molecular systems relevant to organic photovoltaics (OPV) by shining light on the sample. Preliminary results indicate that we can observe exciton formation in model OPV systems.\n2. AFM can be used to measure the ground state and excited state energy levels of quantum dots, and possibly molecules, by understanding dissipation of the AFM cantilever. AFM techniques can also be used to measure variations in the surface potential on semiconductors and oxide surfaces. We discovered large variation of the surface potential (~250 mV) on length scales of 50 nm. Such large potential variations are expected to strongly affect the operation of nanoscale electronic systems or possibly even adsorption of molecular species.\n3. Finally, I will demonstrate how AFM manipulation techniques in combination with optical microscopy techniques can be used to study axonal degeneration as a result of (localized) trauma, synapse formation dynamics or even enable neuronal engineering by connecting axons with an AFM.\nDr. Peter Grutter \nJanuary 9, 2013 -- 3:00 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nAn Overview of ConSiM (Concordia Silicon Microfabrication Facility) and Optical BioMEMS Lab\nThis presentation will present an overview and outline of recent research activities and possible potential collaborations in the areas of microsystems, microfabrication, BioMEMS and Micro-Nano Integration. The results on many micro-nano devices for varied applications will be presented. Some of the applications include physical sensing, cellular, enzyme and polypeptide diagnosis, photosynthetic power cells, antigen-antibody based biochips, biomechanical interaction based analysis for enzymatic and cellular applications, and various levels of microfluidic-photonics integration and micro-nano integration methods.\nDr. Muthukumaran Packirisamy \n"}

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst.\nThorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes.\nWe are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions.\nThe biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution.\nWhy study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.\nRecent publications\nS.
