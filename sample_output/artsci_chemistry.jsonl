However, Coop students alternate their academic semesters with off-campus paid work terms in government or industrial laboratories.\nMore about the programs\nThe different levels are the Honours, Specialization, Major and Minor programmes. Traditionally Canadian universities required an Honours degree to qualify for admission to a graduate program. In Quebec both the Specialization and the Honours program are accepted as entrance requirements.\nThe difference between the Honours program and the Specialization program is the higher performance level demanded in the Honours program (See Undergraduate Calendar Section 31.003) and the inclusion of the Research Project and Thesis (CHEM 450), which requires independent research work of the student and an oral defence of the thesis before the Department. The Specialization in the chemistry program has the Independent Study and Practicum (CHEM 419), where the student carries out independent study and practical work under the direction of a faculty member. The work is presented to the Department in the form of a scientific poster.\nMany professors recommend, and some require that students in these courses attend or have attended a seminar on plagiarism and the ethical use of information sources.

Biochemistry is the part of chemistry that deals with chemical changes occurring in biologically relevant systems; i.e., changes taking place in living cells that are responsible for life processes.\nChemistry and biochemistry deal with complex concepts, and specialization has become the norm. The traditional subdivisions are physical, inorganic, analytical, organic and biochemistry, but many new interdisciplinary subdivisions have emerged, such as bioinorganic chemistry, computational chemistry, nanochemistry, protein engineering and chemical biology, to name just a few. Each is based on the same fundamental principles of chemistry, but deals with a rather specific aspect. These divisions are all inter-dependent. Many of the important discoveries have been the result of teamwork involving chemists from the various sub-divisions.\n"}

It impacts our lives and the way we do things, and our researchers  are contributing to these developments” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.\n“The patents that Concordia’s innovators have been awarded are the result of years of work, and dedication to the idea of taking research results an extra step and improving a process or a product.”\nFrom inception to commercialization\nMaria Amer , an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was honoured for a noise reduction technology she and her students developed. It improves brightness and colour information in digital images without blurring their details.\nAmer’s new video processing technology is now commercially available through a license deal with wrnch Inc., a company backed up Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban. The video denoising technology was later licensed to Red Giant, an American filmmaking and motion graphics company.\nAmer says her research is driven by the need to innovate, and that commercialization is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n“You cannot fully plan where you go as a researcher,” she adds.\n“I started with a technology in 2009, but it turned out not to be powerful enough against industrial denoisers competition. I felt the challenge to outperform what was currently available on the market, so I asked one of my PhD students to work on this and he excelled.”\nAmer is now working on video object tracking methods. Her goal is to fundamentally advance new technology and scientific knowledge in this area, but if she finds an industry niche, she and her team may turn their attention to applied research.\nInnovating to meet society’s challenges\nEverything from online auction interfaces to self-sealing building materials have been developed at Concordia.\nHere are descriptions of other recently patented inventions:\nBetter braking and steering\nWaizuddin Ahmed , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, specializes in system dynamics and design for road and railway vehicles.\nHe holds a patent on an independently controlled active steering system that not only enhances handling but also improves braking-in-a-turn performance of road vehicles. The independent control is further realized using a fail-safe mechanism and has potential for numerous other applications in active chassis control technology.\nNew dimensions in data\nArmen Atoyan , a senior lecturer of mathematics and statistics in the Faculty of Arts and Science, holds a patent for a new method of record-fast interpolation of data points within a multi-dimensional dataset.\nHis invention is of particular interest for application in the area of digital image processing, including both still and real-time images.\nPurpose-built nanoparticles\nJohn Capobianco , professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, is a specialist in the synthesis, characterization and spectroscopy of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.\nHis patented technology, in part, upconverts nanoparticles’ near-infrared light into the UV, visible and red regions. The results of this research, conducted in collaboration with students and other associates, have attracted considerable attention due their potential biomedical applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.\nSmart sensors for surgery\nJavad Dargahi , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is one of Canada’s leading experts in the application of haptic feedback systems\nIn his work with research associate Saeed Sokhanvar, he developed a patented smart tactile sensor and force and softness haptic feedback systems for robotic applications. His research could be implemented in hospitals offering minimally invasive, endoscopic surgeries.\nStronger, self-healing composites\nSuong Van Hoa , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has had marked success in obtaining patents for new inventions.\nOne area of his research focuses on the detection of defects in composite structures, such as airplanes, automobiles and wind turbines, to ensure that they are safe. His patents include an electrically conductive adhesive sheet for joining structural elements, a self-healing composite material designed to repair cracks and a system for making high-performance epoxies with clay particles.\nNew market mechanisms\nGregory Kersten , a professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, focuses on auctions and negotiations management\nHe developed an innovative market mechanism for procurement in computerized multi-attribute reverse auctions — a situation in which multiple sellers engage in a bidding process with a single buyer. Under Kersten’s mechanism, sellers are constrained to submit bids from admissible sets and the winner is selected by a pre-determined set of the buyer’s preferences that are unknown to the bidders.\nMiniature diagnostic tools\nMuthukumaran Packirisamy , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has been prolific in developing new technologies, having recently patented five new discoveries.\nPackirisamy is a specialist in biomedical microelectromechanical systems, or BioMEMS. Many of his inventions have to do with the miniaturization of photonic components for information technologies and diagnostic tools for health care to detect cancer and other illnesses that may be lurking in a person’s bloodstream. His latest work involves a power cell that harnesses electrical energy from the photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae.\nMore efficient heating systems\nGeorgios Vatistas , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, who has gained international renown for proving Nobel Prize-winner J.J. Thomson’s 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex rings, is an expert in research about how vortices can make energy exchange more economical.\nHis recently patented heat exchanger technology, which uses four to six times less energy to operate and is considerably smaller than a traditional shell-and-tube exchanger, and uses 40 times less energy to operate than the traditional plate heat exchanger, builds on his previous work in swirling water and air flows.\nFind out more about resources for Concordia researchers .\nPresentations at Concordia's Technology and Innovation Recognition event were also made by some of the university's partners in innovation support, including Aligo Innovation, TandemLaunch and Fasken Martineau.\n \n"}

The catch? There are worms involved. \nThe study’s lead author, Louise Hénault-Ethier, carried out her research while pursuing a master’s from what is now Concordia’s  Individualized program . She experimented with different methods of vermicomposting to see whether they could sufficiently inactivate certain bacteria for safe public use of the compost. \n“Centralized composting, which is one of the fastest growing industrial composting methods, has strict governmental guidelines, requiring thermal sanitation to prevent the survival of harmful bacteria,” she says.\nThe guidelines require that the compost reaches and maintains a heat of 55 degrees Celsius over a period of three days in a self-heating process driven by decomposer microorganisms found in the compost. \n“But in our case, worms graze on the decomposer community, preventing the onset of high temperatures. We wanted to see if vermicomposting, which proceeds at room temperature could still get rid of harmful bacteria.”\nHénault-Ethier worked with Concordia chemistry professor Yves Gélinas and biology professor  Vincent Martin to examine the impact of vermicomposting on E. coli, a bacteria often found in fecal matter that can easily make its way into organic waste set to be composted. \nThey devised three experiments to monitor the presence of E. coli, testing whether the size of the batch of compost, the amount of naturally occurring compost microbes and the rate at which the compost was fed would affect the survival of the pathogen. \nTime and again, the worms worked their magic and eventually produced compost that respected the regulatory bacterial count limits. When the normal compost microbes or worms were present, E. coli declined more rapidly. Without worms or with sterile compost, it took a little more time to get there.  \n\"We found that the compost batches take on average 18 to 21 days to decrease the E. coli to levels well below the legal limit,” explains Gélinas, who worked closely with Hénault-Ethier to examine how the chemicals, such as Carbon, Nitrogen or sugars, present in the compost materials would affect the bacteria’s survival.\n“While that's slower than traditional composting methods, it’s not a prohibitive amount of time.\"\n‘Upcycling waste’\nFor Hénault-Ethier, who was recently named head of scientific projects for the David Suzuki Foundation , it’s the added benefits of vermicomposting that are most important, beyond the results of the E. coli survival experiments.\n\"The compost it produces may lead to higher plant yields when used as a fertilizer, and — even more surprising — the red wigglers themselves could then be reused as feed for other animals on the food chain,” she says.\nThis is what's called “upcycling” — generating something more valuable than the initial waste product.\nAlthough the idea of using invertebrates as animal feed may seem a little strange, it’s actually a proven method for potentially replacing the resource-intensive soybeans or fish meal traditionally used. \n\"This study suggests that upcycling technologies like vermicomposting can be more widely developed for commercial use,” says Hénault-Ethier. As a past environmental coordinator for Concordia, she spearheaded a large-scale worm-farming project in which 15 tons of the university’s waste were composted per year.\n“Though traditional compost can rapidly kill potential pathogens through heat, industrial composting may actually take longer to reach maturity than vermicomposting. Why not wait a little longer to see pathogen declines in vermicomposting and then create a product that provides nutrient-rich feed to both plants and animals? It's a win-win situation.\"\nThe results show that vermicomposting is a promising method in the sanitation of organic waste, which would allow for producing proteins for animal feed.\nThat said, while the E. coli inactivation observed in the current study is promising, Hénault-Ethier cautions that further research on a more diverse array of pathogens is still required.\n"}

Herein, we report the anionic polymerization of allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) on methoxy-PEG (mPEG) as macroinitiator to produce the diblock copolymer mPEG-b-PAGE. The mPEG-b-PAGE copolymer was then used as a common precursor to generate a systematic series of copolymers derivatized with pendant alkyl chains via thiolene click chemistry. These amphiphilic block copolymers were found to self-assemble in aqueous solution to form aggregates with distinct and unique morphologies. Depending on the hydrophobic weight fraction of the copolymer, spheres, long filomicelles, rods, disks and polymersomes with confirmed biocompatibility were formed. These materials were evaluated in terms of ability to solubilize the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). For each copolymer, stable micelle formulations were prepared that included high DOX to copolymer ratios of up to 20 % (wt%) with drug loading efficiencies > 60 % (w/w). In vitro drug release studies, conducted under physiologically relevant conditions, revealed sustained release profiles. Assessment of cytotoxicity in OVCAR8 human ovarian cancer cells grown in monolayers and spheroids confirmed that the activity of the formulated drug was conserved. The promising preliminary assessment of these alkylated copolymers encourages additional evaluation in vivo.\nDr. Le Dévédec carried out his undergraduate degree in biochemistry at UQAM. Under the supervision of Prof. M.A Mateescu, he completed his MSc in biochemistry in 2008 (with Honors). His work focused on the development of chromatographic devices for the separation of chitosan oligomers and the synthesis of polyalkylated chitosan for oral delivery.\nIn 2008, he carried out his PhD, under the supervision of Prof. Julian Zhu at the University of Montreal, where he developed his skills in polymer chemistry and novel polymer drug delivery systems.\nAfter a brief time in the pharmaceutical industry, he moved to Ontario where he is currently carrying out his postdoctoral research in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto, with Christine Allen. His research interests focus on the development and characterization of copolymers for sustained release of hydrophobic drugs from nano-scale delivery system to implantable devices, as well as the study of drug-polymer compatibility and the tunable morphology of drug carrier.\nHe is the guest of Dr. John Oh\nWhere\nRoom SP-S110, Richard J.

I read scientific magazines, watched scientific TV shows and made my own observations from scientific experiments.\nCindy Buonomano\nNaturally, in school, I oriented my education towards science and, more specifically, chemistry. I was interested in finding out how everything works on a molecular level.\nChemistry has brought many great moments of joy to my life. In high school, I was able to travel to Paris for a contest when I was only 17 years old. And now, here I am in Quebec to realize my dreams and maybe become a professor who can inspire other young scientists.\nManiya Aghasibeig: I became fascinated with materials science after I took a high school course on the subject, and got familiar with various types of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers etc.) with different structures and properties.\nA year later, just prior to choosing an undergraduate major, I met someone who studied in the field, and he explained to me about its diversity and its flexibility: it can be used in many different technologies, from aerospace to health care. That was when I knew that I wanted to study in this field.\nUsually when I first contact people by email and introduce myself as a PhD candidate who studies mechanical engineering, they assume that I am a guy. Later, when we meet in person or speak on the phone, they are very surprised to see/hear a girl!\nTell us about what you're researching now, and why.\nCB: I am currently a PhD student in organic chemistry. I decided to take the PhD path because I want to be a professor. In the last few years, while supervising undergraduate students, I discovered a true passion for teaching.\nIn organic chemistry, our goal is to build drugs or molecules with a potential material application. To do it, we have to develop new methods to synthesize these interesting molecules. My research project is \"Synthesis of Heteroaromatic Compounds via Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling and Directed Ortho-Metalation Reactions.\"\nManiya Aghasibeig\nMA: I work on manufacturing nickel electrodes using different thermal spraying techniques for hydrogen production by water electrolysis.\nThis hydrogen can be stored, converted and used later — for instance, for electricity production with no emissions other than water vapour.\nThe need for green and renewable energy resources arises from increasing concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels, in addition to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming that occur alongside the fast development of modern industries.\nThese manufactured electrodes are expected to increase the efficiency of the water electrolysis process by increasing the rate of hydrogen production and lowering the process costs. \nWere you inspired by other women in your field?\nMA: My mentor was my boss from my last industrial job: Barbara Maroli at Höganäs AB in Sweden. She was extremely knowledgeable, determined and successful in her career. She became my role model the first day I met her.\nWhen I told her that I wanted to study for a PhD she was truly encouraging and supportive. She helped me to explore my options and make a decision with confidence.\nCB: Many women inspired me, like  Marie Curie , who got the Nobel Prize in chemistry and in physics, and  Valentina Tereshkova , the first woman to go to space. I told my little self that if these women were able to go that far, why can't I?\nI've had so many people in my life tell me that I would not succeed in my studies and I should stop. I am glad I never listened to them! It is hard to be a woman in a world dominated by male scientists, but trust me: you are as good as them. So be strong, and inspire other little girls to do the same.\nFind out how to study  mechanical and industrial engineering  or  chemistry and biochemistry  at Concordia. \n \n"}

The program provides students with an opportunity to obtain the greatest possible expertise in their chosen area of specialization. Graduates are talented, well-trained researchers. They are valued as employees in the private and public sectors, as well as in institutions of higher learning.\n \nDegree requirements\nRequirements for the Degree\nCredits. A candidate entering the doctoral program with a master’s degree is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits. A candidate entering the doctoral program under accelerated admission (fast-tracking) from the BSc program is required to complete a minimum of 9 credits from graduate courses listed under Topics in addition to the regular 90 credits; a candidate entering the doctoral program under accelerated admission (fast-tracking) from the MSc program is required to complete a minimum of 3 credits listed under Topics in addition to the regular 90 credits.\nResidence. The minimum period of residence is two years (6 terms) of full-time graduate study beyond the master’s degree or three years (9 terms) of full-time graduate study (or the equivalent in part-time study) beyond the bachelor’s degree for those students who are permitted to enrol for doctoral studies without completing a master’s degree. It should be understood that this is a minimum requirement, and that a longer period may be necessary in order to complete all of the work that is required for the degree.\nCourses. The following are required of fully-qualified students:\n6 credits from courses listed under Topics, in the general field of the student’s research project.\nCHEM 896: Research Proposal and Comprehensive Examination (9 credits).\nA student in the doctoral program is required to present a progress report on his/her research and on future research plans. The presentation should reflect the student’s awareness of current research in his/her field and demonstrate an ability to carry out a significant research problem and provide a rational approach to its solution. The student’s knowledge and understanding of fundamental chemical and biochemical principles will also be examined.\nThe student is expected to complete CHEM 896 within 18 months of admission directly into the PhD program, or within 28 months of admission via the MSc stream. In exceptional circumstances the department may permit an extension of time for completion of this course. The CHEM 896 Examining Committee assigns one of the following two grades: (a) PASS - the student is admitted to candidacy for a PhD degree in Chemistry; (b) FAIL - the student must withdraw from the program.\nCHEM 855: Doctoral Research and Thesis (69 credits).\nCHEM 667 and 668: Seminars (3 credits each).\nThese seminar courses provide opportunities for the student to prepare and present material concerning a current research problem in an area of chemistry or biochemistry to a critical audience. One seminar, CHEM 668, is on the student’s own research while the other, CHEM 667, must be a literature seminar on a different topic.

I also employ molecular modelling to understand tropospheric photochemical reactions, especially in an urban air quality context. I have significant field experience in developing and deploying analytical instrumentation in the High Arctic.\nCurrently, I am interested in statistical analysis of medium sized data sets (up to 500,000 observations), including multivariate data analysis of partially dichotomous data. I am very much interested interpreting measurement data for the application and validation of atmospheric chemistry models. My main statistical tools for data analysis are  Matlab  and  R . I use the CAABA/MECCA box model for atmospheric molecular modelling.\nMy current research focuses on long-term observations of urban pollutants in major Canadian cities. The research is comprised of  statistical analysis of 1o  year pollution data and atmospheric modelling using the box model  MECCA/CAABA  and multivariate chemometric modelling in Matlab and R.\nUntil recently, I was a collaborator on the  EU funded FP7 MYCOSPEC project , where I perform multivariate modelling of mid-infrared data for classification of contaminated agricultural commodities. I have recently explored non-parametric machine learning algorithms such as bagged decision trees.\nPreviously, I was a lead author and chapter coordinator for the Canadian Mercury Science Assessment for the \"Emissions\" Chapter. I have also conducted a statistical evaluation of gaseous and reactive mercury species data from observations and model results. All mercury work was done in collaboration with Environment Canada.\nDuring field studies in the High Arctic (in Alert, NU and Barrow, AK), I investigated the exchange of volatile organic compounds between snow and air using GC-FID and GC-MS.\nPublications\nPeer reviewed publications\nP.

With the recent advances in femtosecond spectroscopy, which now permit the observation of chemical reactions in real time, there is an ever increasing interest in such theoretical studies, as they can predict, explain and guide experiments. In particular, molecular dynamics simulations allow one to simulate the motion of atoms and molecules at the microscopic level as chemical reactions occur, providing invaluable information about their molecular mechanisms and kinetics. Dynamical studies are essential since they provide a link between potential energy surfaces determined by electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements of the chemical dynamics and thermodynamics. Because chemical reactions occur in various phases of nature, our research involves reactive systems in the gas phase, condensed phases, and clusters, which are considered to be novel intermediate states of matter. Clusters can be used as tools for selective microsolvation, or they can be a distinct class of materials with unique properties.\nOur computer simulations typically involve high-performance scientific computing on state-of-the art workstations and supercomputers, and we make use of a wide arsenal of computational tools which take their roots in quantum chemistry, classical and quantum mechanics, and statistical thermodynamics. Extensive use is made of semiempirical, approximate and ab initio electronic structure theory, both in the gas-phase and in solution, molecular modeling, molecular dynamics and pioneering first-principles simulation techniques. We are particularly interested in studying solvation effects and dynamics in liquids and small clusters, organic and biologically relevant reactions, photochemical processes, metal and semiconductor cluster fragmentation, environmentally and technologically relevant chemical reactions, cluster and materials science in general. We maintain an intensive collaboration with renown experimentalists worldwide, as connection with experiment is crucial for assessing the reliability of our computer simulations and theoretical models, which, in turn can be used to improve our fundamental understanding of chemistry.\nAreas of method development and application:\n• Nanomaterials and materials science\n• Water structure and solvation effects\n• Chemical biology\n• First-principles, approximate and efficient molecular dynamics techniques\nSelected on-going research projects:\n• Carbon chemistry, encapsulation and spin catalysis\n• Dense transition metal nitride nanoparticles\n• Cluster materials and amorphous materials (such as glasses)\n• Catalysis of chemical reactions by clusters, surfaces and zeolites\n• Chemistry with a hammer (how to induce chemical reactions that do not occur under normal conditions)\n• Charge-transfer-to-solvent phenomena in clusters\n• Excited-state electron and molecular dynamics and femtosecond spectroscopy\n• Water in confined environments\n• Microsolvation in chemical reaction dynamics\n• Solvation structure of molecular ions, thermodynamics and spectroscopy\n• Molecular ions at interfaces and their effects on phase behavior and role in biology\n• Diffusion and reaction of small molecules in proteins (myoglobin, hemoglobin, GAPDH)\n• Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of proteins\n• Small-molecule permeation of lipid bilayers\nPublications\nSelected Refereed Journal Articles\nSoran Jahangiri,* Valéry Legris-Falardeau* and Gilles H.
