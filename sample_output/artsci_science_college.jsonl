It also provides an opportunity for students to get together over lunch. The atmosphere is science — whether it be wrestling with a problem together, talking with a teacher, or proposing a new idea for discussion. This type of social interaction is an all-important factor in the life of scientists — who spend a lot of their career interacting with others in the field — and is the best way to gain a real understanding of scientific problems. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, to help each other, and to learn from each other. All are seen as essential ingredients of an education.\nOur  research  component is unique in Canada. Students are not just doing laboratory exercises. They are active and interested participants in the resolution of current scientific problems. This role both sharpens their understanding of science and gives them first-hand experience with what to expect from a scientific career.

These research projects allow students to acquire first-hand scientific experience. The research may be carried out with scientists at Concordia or at some other university or research institution. In recent years, students have completed projects at universities like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Rochester, Frankfurt, Freiberg, Paris, Berlin, Innsbruck, San Diego, Johns Hopkins, London University, England, Simon Fraser University, Barbados, Miami and others. The work of the student is supervised and graded either by a faculty member or by an academically qualified person at the outside institution. \nAn attractive aspect of this program is that students are expected to participate in research projects outside their field. One can find a physics student doing experiments in neurophysiology, or a biology student participating in a computer project. This program is the core of our curriculum and is unique in Canada.

Students should see it in that light.\nScience education is traditionally compartmentalized into departments, but science itself crosses those borders.\nThe Science College must have an encouraging and noncompetitive atmosphere and style.\nThe elements of the Science College were chosen with these principles in mind.\nStudents are involved in actual research for their entire stay at the College.\nStudents do at least 6 credits in the history and philosophy of science.\nStudents take interdisciplinary courses designed specifically for them.\nA document embodying all the above mentioned facts was presented to the Arts and Science faculty council and then to the Concordia University Senate. It was approved on April 27, 1979. To publicize the new college, the Science College  public lectures  were created, and they are still one of the major public events of the Science College.\nAs the years have passed there has been a greater demand for this type of programme and the College has grown. In 1979, there were 12 students compared to over 80 currently. But this number is still quite small and with good reason. Small numbers make for an intense learning experience where students get to know and work with each other, question the status quo, get an overview of science as a whole and participate in cutting edge research in three different areas during their tenure. The result is that Science College alumni can be found in top positions in science and medicine, both in Canada and abroad.\nContact us\nScience College:\n514-848-2424 ext. 2595\n"}

Our enrolment has increased from 12 students in 1979 to the current number of 70 students. The College accepts 20 to 30 students every year.\nCriteria of eligibility\nThe criteria for eligibility necessitates that the applicant to apply to the Science College, must be enrolled in one of the Natural science programmes, namely: Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Computer Science, Exercise Science, Geography, Journalism, Physics, Psychology (B.Sc. or B.A. in Cognitive Science), and Mathematics but Actuarial Mathematics is excluded.\nThe interview\nStudents are granted an interview if the student is accepted at Concordia University. The personal interview is the key determinant for acceptance to the college. To be accepted students must possess a good academic background in natural sciences and excellent grades and complementary involvement outside the academic field.\nOther considerations\nWhen an individual applies to the college, first the grades are evaluated and a decision is made whether to grant that individual an interview. The personal interview dictates one’s acceptance to the college. Consequently, student’s exhibits exceptional motivation and aptitude but those whose performance at the interview supersede their ability to obtain excellent grades are accepted to the college. Many of these students evolve as amongst the college’s best achievers.\nWhen one applies to the Science College, one's grades are looked at and taken into account, however, large emphasis is placed on the personal interview. Hence, students who show exceptional motivation and capacity, but for some reason were not successful in obtaining the best grades can be accepted. Many of these students turn out to be among the College's high achievers.\nEach student is sent a letter after the interview and, if accepted, confirmation must be sent to the College.\nContacts\nContact us  to arrange an interview or visit Science College. \nContact us\nScience College:\n514-848-2424 ext. 2595\n"}

That film won Best Short Documentary at the 2007 Montreal World Film Festival (MWFF).\n“The first time I walked into Cinema L’Amour I was a 20-year-old Concordia student, and I had no idea this theatre was an architectural gem,” says Hancox. “I had heard the legend of magician Harry Houdini being fatally punched there — which wasn’t true — but it is an odd place that serves a special niche.”\nThe film helped propel his career. “It is a film people still ask me about. I think people will go see a film about a porn theatre even if it’s a bad film, to be honest. So I don’t know how much credit I can take for making a good film!” Hancox says.\n“But to have my film win at the MWFF was amazing, especially for it do so well as a student film. I was proud of the film, it got a lot of attention, and several years later it was actually screened in Cinema L’Amour during Nuit Blanche in front of a packed house, which was the greatest accomplishment! It was full circle for me.”\nJay Baruchel goes on road trip to Ireland and Scotland in Celtic Soul. | Photo courtesy Markham Street Films\nAfter working as a television editor and director of photography, Hancox joined the Toronto-based Markham Street Films as their director of Sales and Development in 2010. Today he is the company’s vice-president, Unscripted, and produced their 2014 feature doc David & Me about the wrongful murder conviction of David McCallum, a film that helped exonerate McCallum after 29 years in prison.\n“I want to be humble about this because I was one of many people who helped free David McCallum. I was one small part in getting this film made,” says Hancox.\n“David was the biggest part, his resilience, his hope and belief in his innocence. It was the best moment of my career, and may be the best moment of my life, being there the day David walked out of jail.”\nFortunate friendship\nHancox’s new film, Celtic Soul, came to him unsolicited.\n“Jay and I are actually old high school friends from N.D.G. We went to FACE school together in the ’90s, were in a band and had this great friendship,” Hancox explains.\n“We hadn’t been in touch for a few years and, believe it or not, that relationship had nothing to do with the genesis of this film. It was just a great coincidence that the film was brought to us by a mutual friend, Eoin O’Callaghan, who said they had cooked up this idea for a documentary,” he says.\n“As it turned, I was an old friend of Jay’s — that was a really nice bonus. The film is very rock and roll: It is able to walk this fine line between fart jokes and a really heartfelt story about friendship, immigration and the Irish plight, and how sport can be a force for good.”\nCeltic Soul premieres at the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema in Toronto on November 25, 2016, with Baruchel and O’Callaghan in attendance.\nNow based in Toronto, Hancox recalls growing up in N.D.G. “I miss Chalet Bar-B-Q, Spurs country bar, Supermarché Akhavan and the Rose Bowl, and I miss Honey Martin, where I used to play with my former band The Future Ex-Wives every Thursday night,” says Hancox.\n“Much like Jay, I like to say that I’m from N.D.G. before I say Montreal.”\nHancox adds that his time at Concordia was vital in shaping his career. “Concordia was crucial and informative,” he says.\n“Quite simply, I learned how to make films at Concordia, and to make media responsibly. I realize I truly have the privilege and position to tell important stories.”\nWatch the trailer for Celtic Soul:\n&amp;nbsp;\n"}

The video denoising technology was later licensed to Red Giant, an American filmmaking and motion graphics company.\nAmer says her research is driven by the need to innovate, and that commercialization is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n“You cannot fully plan where you go as a researcher,” she adds.\n“I started with a technology in 2009, but it turned out not to be powerful enough against industrial denoisers competition. I felt the challenge to outperform what was currently available on the market, so I asked one of my PhD students to work on this and he excelled.”\nAmer is now working on video object tracking methods. Her goal is to fundamentally advance new technology and scientific knowledge in this area, but if she finds an industry niche, she and her team may turn their attention to applied research.\nInnovating to meet society’s challenges\nEverything from online auction interfaces to self-sealing building materials have been developed at Concordia.\nHere are descriptions of other recently patented inventions:\nBetter braking and steering\nWaizuddin Ahmed , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, specializes in system dynamics and design for road and railway vehicles.\nHe holds a patent on an independently controlled active steering system that not only enhances handling but also improves braking-in-a-turn performance of road vehicles. The independent control is further realized using a fail-safe mechanism and has potential for numerous other applications in active chassis control technology.\nNew dimensions in data\nArmen Atoyan , a senior lecturer of mathematics and statistics in the Faculty of Arts and Science, holds a patent for a new method of record-fast interpolation of data points within a multi-dimensional dataset.\nHis invention is of particular interest for application in the area of digital image processing, including both still and real-time images.\nPurpose-built nanoparticles\nJohn Capobianco , professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, is a specialist in the synthesis, characterization and spectroscopy of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.\nHis patented technology, in part, upconverts nanoparticles’ near-infrared light into the UV, visible and red regions. The results of this research, conducted in collaboration with students and other associates, have attracted considerable attention due their potential biomedical applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.\nSmart sensors for surgery\nJavad Dargahi , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is one of Canada’s leading experts in the application of haptic feedback systems\nIn his work with research associate Saeed Sokhanvar, he developed a patented smart tactile sensor and force and softness haptic feedback systems for robotic applications. His research could be implemented in hospitals offering minimally invasive, endoscopic surgeries.\nStronger, self-healing composites\nSuong Van Hoa , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has had marked success in obtaining patents for new inventions.\nOne area of his research focuses on the detection of defects in composite structures, such as airplanes, automobiles and wind turbines, to ensure that they are safe. His patents include an electrically conductive adhesive sheet for joining structural elements, a self-healing composite material designed to repair cracks and a system for making high-performance epoxies with clay particles.\nNew market mechanisms\nGregory Kersten , a professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, focuses on auctions and negotiations management\nHe developed an innovative market mechanism for procurement in computerized multi-attribute reverse auctions — a situation in which multiple sellers engage in a bidding process with a single buyer. Under Kersten’s mechanism, sellers are constrained to submit bids from admissible sets and the winner is selected by a pre-determined set of the buyer’s preferences that are unknown to the bidders.\nMiniature diagnostic tools\nMuthukumaran Packirisamy , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has been prolific in developing new technologies, having recently patented five new discoveries.\nPackirisamy is a specialist in biomedical microelectromechanical systems, or BioMEMS. Many of his inventions have to do with the miniaturization of photonic components for information technologies and diagnostic tools for health care to detect cancer and other illnesses that may be lurking in a person’s bloodstream. His latest work involves a power cell that harnesses electrical energy from the photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae.\nMore efficient heating systems\nGeorgios Vatistas , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, who has gained international renown for proving Nobel Prize-winner J.J. Thomson’s 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex rings, is an expert in research about how vortices can make energy exchange more economical.\nHis recently patented heat exchanger technology, which uses four to six times less energy to operate and is considerably smaller than a traditional shell-and-tube exchanger, and uses 40 times less energy to operate than the traditional plate heat exchanger, builds on his previous work in swirling water and air flows.\nFind out more about resources for Concordia researchers .\nPresentations at Concordia's Technology and Innovation Recognition event were also made by some of the university's partners in innovation support, including Aligo Innovation, TandemLaunch and Fasken Martineau.\n \n"}

We invited Iowa State University professor Hector Avalos , an expert on religious violence who is also one of the book’s contributors. With acts of extremism rising in the world we felt it necessary to engage with this topic.\nWhen a violent attack occurs, news agencies normally interview government officials, sociologists or political analysts. Rarely do we hear from people specializing in religion or theological studies. But we should, because those who perpetrate these atrocities use religious rhetoric to legitimize their actions. Certainly disenfranchisement, poverty and marginalization play a role, but there is definitely also a religious angle that needs to be explored.\nWhy do you think religion has been largely absent from the dialogue concerning radicalization?\nAG: It’s a sensitive topic because when you talk about religion you talk about people’s identities. Unfortunately these days, religious violence is associated with Islam and Muslims. And that is why people are very careful in the way they speak about religion and violence.\nWhat we try to show in the book is that religion has a lot of different manifestations. Whether it’s the Bible or the Qur’an, there are many good aspects, such as the practice of certain ethical precepts. However, in these same texts there are darker sides, where God commands the extermination of enemies, for example. \nMany religious groups manage to not read these texts literally and understand them from another perspective or context. But there are groups that refuse to interpret them symbolically and instead take them word for word.\nSalafists are a minority — a sub-group — of Islam which we cannot completely disassociate from the religion itself. Even within salafism there are sub-groups — some more peaceful than others — which all claim to represent Islam. It’s the same thing when it comes to Christian fundamentalists. We wouldn’t say they are not Christians, but they in no way represent all of Christianity.\nIn the book, we look at various traditions to examine the global impact of religious violence. We address religious traditions across different geographical locations and how religious violence manifests itself not only in the Middle East, but in Africa, Europe and North America. \nIs there a common thread that links religious extremism around the world?\nAG: The thread is the way we define religion. It is a way of life and thought that presupposes the existence of and relationship with unverifiable forces and beings. When an unempirical entity whose existence cannot be verified commands someone to act violently then this becomes an ethical problem. This is why scholars need to speak up. \nIn the essay that you contribute to the book, you talk about the tyranny of political correctness when it comes to talking about religion and extremism. What do you mean by this? \nAG: We really cannot put everybody in the same basket. In the case of Islam, it is clear that most Muslims are not violent. This is why people are sometimes afraid that Muslims will be marginalized when Islam is mentioned in the context of violence.\nWe hear things like “ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.” But at the same time, ISIS justifies its own violent actions by de-contextualizing passages from the Qur’an or from the life of Muhammad.\nWho are we to say from the outside that this has nothing to do with religion, when those committing violent acts tell us it does? Isn’t it some sort of intellectual colonialism when we attribute motivations to others that are contrary to what they are telling us?\nHow can examining religion in the context of extremism help to reduce radicalization?\nAG: It all comes down to education. We need to specifically teach what is meant by religious extremism and how it can sometimes lead to violence, and not make generalizations.\nI think this starts in high school. Young people need to be religiously literate — not through faith-based literacy, but by acquiring a better understanding of religious beliefs and practices from a historical and comparative perspective. We think that religion is this archaic thing but it’s always going to be there. Therefore, our goal should be to educate and develop critical thinking in relation to all religious traditions. \nA book launch for The Global Impact of Religious Violence will take place at the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies on Wednesday, November 30 from 12 to 1:30 p.m. in FB-804, Faubourg Building, 1250 Guy Street.\nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Theological Studies.\n \n"}

Klein Prize for Poetry.\nThe awards were presented at the annual Quebec Writers' Federation (QWF) Awards Gala this Tuesday, November 22, at the Corona Theatre.\nDrukker's poems had already earned her a CBC Literary Award and a Norma Epstein Foundation Award in Creative Writing. She was also a finalist for the 2016  Grand Prix du livre de Montréal . Her work has appeared in The Malahat Review and enRoute , among other places.\nCurrently, Drukker is pursuing a PhD in humanities at Concordia.\nHer poem, “Niamh,” is from the first section of Small Fires. It’s set on Inis Mόr, the largest of the three Aran Islands, off the west coast of County Galway, Ireland.\n \nYou go down deep.  Touch the white pelt of winter\nocean, stroke the sand that rolls like bear fur, white-edged\nsoftness of loosed minerals.  Hair from the shore, seaweed\nbands cold mouths around your burnt and salted skin.\nYou swim every winter’s day; the ocean calls your feet\nto make their way to the violet mouth of foam\nand periwinkles.  You feel them, clipped and silvered\nunder the ocean’s shell, for cold makes us immune to slights\nand slivers.  A sliced toe on beach glass blooms to anemones\nbeneath the ocean’s skin, four months of slicing open winter’s\nwhite-capped belly, sliding in.  Once I saw you swim, an otter\nor a winter bear, and stopped myself, for why does woman\nbecome some other animal when she enters winter water, hair\ncurly and gold-tipped with salt and frost?  Niamh, you move\nslowly, shoulders rounded, fleshy pink.  If I painted you\nanother way, if I only said you lived alone, cuticles raw\nwith coal dust, I’d be forcing emptiness into your days that isn’t\nthere—for the ocean’s mouth, barbed with blue, and sea grass\nmoving soundlessly across your feet receive you: free of flesh\nand time, swimming out to meet the waves as all sea creatures do.\n"}

Latimer\nCatherine Bolton: “Our community has a huge amount to teach us.” | Photo by David Ward\nWhether it’s archaeology, urban design or pastoral ministry, Concordia offers an array of courses that send students off campus. The goal? To encourage in-person collaboration with local businesses and community associations and provide unique learning experiences.\n“To date, we offer 168 designated ‘CBEL’ courses, meaning community-based experiential learning ,” says Catherine Bolton , Concordia’s vice-provost of Teaching and Learning.\n“Citizenship involves being aware of your community and working with it. These courses are tremendously effective ways to train students to think rationally and critically.” \nBolton credits the Living Knowledge research project, funded by the Office of Community Engagement (OCE), for creating the online directory of 168 CBEL courses , organized by faculty. The project reflects at least three of Concordia’s Strategic Directions: Embrace the City, Embrace the World , Teach for Tomorrow and Get Your Hands Dirty .\n“These findings helped us to identify the extended CBEL community. The list is a living document and we hope to populate it with more courses,” says Bolton.\n“Sometimes, there's a professor doing CBEL and we just don't know because the course description is generic. So, we're looking to have professors help inform us and figure out how we can build more relationships — supporting our university’s development, our students and the community at the same time.” \nStudents take the lead\nRaymond Paquin , for one, tries to incorporate CBEL into as many of his management courses at the John Molson School of Business as possible, including the popular “MANA 369 - Business and Sustainability.\"\n“I don't send students to specific companies. Instead, I encourage them to go into the community and look around — to think of the places they frequent and how they can become involved,,” says Paquin.\n“What they need is to think about what's practical, given time constraints — the students have nine weeks — and the potential for actual change. This often means working with small organizations and those that are willing.”\nRecently, several students in Paquin’s course had an ambitious idea: to retrofit their apartment building’s lighting system. They did a full analysis, with recommendations and planning, then presented it to their property manager. The project was accepted and construction began immediately.\n“Not everyone is guaranteed such a ‘light-bulb’ moment,” says Paquin. “However, many times there are enough light bulbs, meaning examples of real impact, in the class that the students who didn't get their own ‘ah-ha moment’ can sense the possibilities and still benefit.”\n‘We need to respect what our community needs’\nCBEL opportunities exist across Concordia’s three other faculties too, from the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science ’s “SOEN 490 - Capstone software engineering design\" to the Faculty of Arts and Science ’s “URBS 333 - Urban Laboratory\" to “DART 453 - Design and Community Engagement\" in the Faculty of Fine Arts .\nOne of the things Bolton learned while talking to people involved in CBEL is the importance of reciprocity.\n“We need to respect our community and what they need if we want to go into their world,” she says.\n“It can't be a one-way street. They're not a laboratory. They have a huge amount to teach us.”\nBolton notes that the OCE is working on finding more community partners and developing a list of potential future collaborators.\n“Ultimately, we want to establish long-term relationships,” says Bolton. “If faculty members are interested in learning more about how to incorporate CBEL into their courses, contact Rob Cassidy at the Centre for Teaching and Learning and contact the OCE.”\nFind out more about the Concordia’s Office of Community Engagement .\n \n"}

I began a Master’s Degree in 2014 with Dr. Grant E. Brown, where my research focused on studying Neophobia in Trinidadian Guppies.\nI was recently fast-tracked into the PhD program, where I will continue and expand upon my research. The amazing community of students, faculty, and staff at Concordia played a large role in my decision to stay for my PhD.\n In addition to pursuing graduate studies at Concordia, I am also the Science Liaison Officer for the Student Success Center, where I work with Student Learning Services to create and design improved study and tutoring programs for science students.\nThe resources available at Concordia and the wonderful support from both students and faculty have played a huge role in my academic success. I have built friendships and connections that will last a life time.\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo (Department of History):\nI am second-year MA History student. In my thesis, I explore the life and work of fin-de-siècle French literary critic, novelist, and traveller Thérèse (Th.) Bentzon, writing a history of her intellectual life across borders. Using Bentzon’s travelogues about the ‘condition of women’ in the United States and Canada as a starting point, I investigate the link between mobility, the development of feminism, and the making of a modern self in the nineteenth century. \nI came to history by way of journalism, having completed a BA in Journalism and German at Concordia. I was originally drawn to the Master’s program in History because of the groundbreaking work being done at the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.\nThat said, the History Department has given me the invaluable opportunity to explore my research interests in gender and women’s history, histories of empire, travel, global feminism, and autobiography and life writings. My supervisor, Dr. Barbara Lorenzkowski, grounds me in the historical craft while also encouraging me to forge links across disciplinary boundaries.\nPrior to starting graduate studies, my time as a student journalist took me to Istanbul, where I reported on the Gezi Park protests in 2013, and to Munich, where I worked in communications and penned a travel blog in the summer of 2014. As an early-career scholar, I aim to combine the storytelling elements of journalism with the academic rigueur of a historian through her work.\nI hope to pursue my PhD in History, looking at the comparative emergence of feminist ideologies in France and Britain in the nineteenth century, as of Fall 2017.\nRelated topics\n"}

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

I regularly teach Biochemistry I (CHEM271) and Biochemistry II (CHEM375). Biochemistry I is an introductory course and covers the basics of biochemistry including enzymology, protein structure and metabolism. Biochemistry II covers more of the specific biochemical reactions involved in metabolic pathways. I also teach Discovering Biotechnology (CHEM209) which is an introduction to the world of biotechnology for non-scientists. This course covers topics such as cloning and genetic engineering and includes discussions of the societal and ethical issues that are involved. In the past few years I have also taught graduate courses in Protein Targeting and Membrane Biochemistry.\nPublications\nRecent publications\nChakraborty PK, Schmitz-Abe K, Kennedy EK, Mamady H, Naas T, Durie D, CampagnaDR, Lau A, Sendamarai AK, Wiseman DH, May A, Jolles S, Connor P, Powell C,Heeney MM, Giardina PJ, Klaassen RJ, Kannengiesser C, Thuret I, Thompson AA,Marques L, Hughes S, Bonney DK, Bottomley SS, Wynn RF, Laxer RM, Minniti CP,Moppett J, Bordon V, Geraghty M, Joyce PBM, Markianos K, Rudner AM, Holcik M,Fleming MD (2014) Mutations in TRNT1, encoding the CCA-adding enzyme, causecongenital sideroblastic anemia with B cell immunodeficiency, periodic feversand developmental delay (SIFD).

Prior to this he held his first post doctoral fellowship at the August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), where he also taught in the Department of Cell Biology. He received a PhD in Medical Physiology from Lund University (Sweden) and has a strong background in molecular biology and protein chemistry after studies at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund University (MSc., Chemical Engineering).\nEducation\nPhD (Lund University), MSc (Lund University)\nResearch interests\nThe main research interests in Dr Bergdahl’s lab lies in studies of the blood vessel wall with a focus on understanding this system during physiologically stressful situations like exercise as well as pathophysiological conditions. The differentiation and functional properties of smooth muscle cells depend on the cellular environment, and any disturbance of this, such as endothelial damage, inflammation or lipid retention will lead to reactions that can initiate atherosclerotic lesions. Dr Bergdahl study mechanisms involved in these processes by using state-of-the-art techniques including electrophysiology, isometric force measurements, functional proteomics, molecular genetics and advanced imaging. The overriding goal is to define conditions that are essential for the normal function and cell differentiation in the vascular wall and to translate these findings from the basic understanding and experimental animal research into clinical understanding of integrative cardiovascular control in health and disease. This is hoped to generate new therapeutic approaches which in the future might lead to better prevention of vascular disease.\nTeaching activities\n"}
