The Department’s programs inspire students with an appreciation of the rich diversity of the living world.\nStudents acquire a comprehensive grounding in modern biology through classroom study as well as extensive hands-on training in research methodology. A variety of specialized laboratories and equipment supports both research and teaching activities.\nPrograms\nThe Biology Department offers Honours and Specialization programs in Biology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and Ecology, as well as Major and Minor programs in Biology. Students planning a career or graduate studies in the biological sciences normally follow the appropriate honours or specialization program. The major program is designed for students who wish to study biology and either obtain a more general education or pursue an additional program in another discipline. The major program can be combined with a major in another department.\nStudents registered in the Honours, Specialization, or Major in Biology may select Biology electives in various subject areas in order to obtain a broad overview of the discipline. However, it is possible for students to pursue in-depth studies in specific areas such as animal biology, plant biology, or microbiology and biotechnology.\nThe minor program can only be taken by students registered in another degree program and provides an opportunity to gain a basic exposure to the main sub-disciplines of Biology or to pursue one such area in some depth.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to take advantage of academic counselling services available in the Biology Department in order to select the program and courses that best meet their needs. Students may transfer among programs after the first year of study since the core courses in all programs are quite similar.\nStudents are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements.\nThe superscript indicates credit value.\nStudents seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in the program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.\n72    BSc Honours in Biology\n27     BIOL 2253, 2263, 2613, 2663, 3673, 4906; CHEM 2213*, 2713\n  3     Chosen from BIOL 3223; CHEM 2123\n12     Chosen from BIOL 2273, 3303, 3373, 3403, 3643, 3663, 3713, 3823, 3853\n30     Chosen from Biology credits** at the 300 and/or 400 levels with at least nine\n         credits at the 400 level\nNOTE: Biology lab requirement: Students must take at least nine credits from Biology courses with lab components (BIOL 227, 330, 337, 340, 368, 382, 450, 466).\nNOTE: Students seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in another program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.

Miceli\nActs of terror are everywhere. Not one day goes by without hearing about the latest suicide bomb in Baghdad, knife stabbing in Germany, or shooting spree in France or in the United States. A Christian extremist preacher claims that homosexuals deserve to die because he considers their lifestyle to be sinful; groups like ISIS perpetrate genocide against religious minorities and call for global jihad against infidels; Buddhist monks in Myanmar persecute the Rohingya for fear that the Muslim minority destroy their country and religion. All these actions seem to be somehow religiously motivated, where the actors claim to act in accordance with their beliefs.\nIn the midst of this spiral of violence seen across traditions and geographical locations, there is a pressing need to understand why people act as such in the name of their faith. The Global Impact of Religious Violence examines why individuals and groups sometimes commit irremediable atrocities, and offers some solutions on how to counter religiously inspired violence.\n\"The essays in this book explore the controversial thesis that religion itself leads to violence, rather than simply being used to justify the actions of angry activists. Though many will argue with this assumption, it contributes to the ongoing discussion about the role of religion in the violent encounters of contemporary public life.\"\n--Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence\nAndré Gagné is a tenured associate professor in the Dept. of Theological Studies at Concordia University (Montreal).

I began a Master’s Degree in 2014 with Dr. Grant E. Brown, where my research focused on studying Neophobia in Trinidadian Guppies.\nI was recently fast-tracked into the PhD program, where I will continue and expand upon my research. The amazing community of students, faculty, and staff at Concordia played a large role in my decision to stay for my PhD.\n In addition to pursuing graduate studies at Concordia, I am also the Science Liaison Officer for the Student Success Center, where I work with Student Learning Services to create and design improved study and tutoring programs for science students.\nThe resources available at Concordia and the wonderful support from both students and faculty have played a huge role in my academic success. I have built friendships and connections that will last a life time.\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo (Department of History):\nI am second-year MA History student. In my thesis, I explore the life and work of fin-de-siècle French literary critic, novelist, and traveller Thérèse (Th.) Bentzon, writing a history of her intellectual life across borders. Using Bentzon’s travelogues about the ‘condition of women’ in the United States and Canada as a starting point, I investigate the link between mobility, the development of feminism, and the making of a modern self in the nineteenth century. \nI came to history by way of journalism, having completed a BA in Journalism and German at Concordia. I was originally drawn to the Master’s program in History because of the groundbreaking work being done at the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.\nThat said, the History Department has given me the invaluable opportunity to explore my research interests in gender and women’s history, histories of empire, travel, global feminism, and autobiography and life writings. My supervisor, Dr. Barbara Lorenzkowski, grounds me in the historical craft while also encouraging me to forge links across disciplinary boundaries.\nPrior to starting graduate studies, my time as a student journalist took me to Istanbul, where I reported on the Gezi Park protests in 2013, and to Munich, where I worked in communications and penned a travel blog in the summer of 2014. As an early-career scholar, I aim to combine the storytelling elements of journalism with the academic rigueur of a historian through her work.\nI hope to pursue my PhD in History, looking at the comparative emergence of feminist ideologies in France and Britain in the nineteenth century, as of Fall 2017.\nRelated topics\n"}

Emphatically so — if you’re biology researcher Grant Brown , that is. On the heels of last week’s discovery of three new species of nearly extinct salamander, the Faculty of Arts and Science professor tells us more about these environmental wizards of the amphibian world.\nWhat makes salamanders so special?\nGrant Brown: Salamanders are particularly interesting because of their trophic position within food webs.  They are prey to a variety of species — birds, mammals and snakes, for example — and are predators on many others, like tadpoles, aquatic invertebrates, some fish and terrestrial invertebrates.\nGiven their role as both predator and prey, they are often used as an indicator of ecosystem health. Anything that disturbs their prey or their predators will be reflected by the salamander population. \nWhy are salamanders particularly good indicators of environmental shifts?\nGB: Salamanders are often considered the “canary in the coal mine” because they are susceptible to small changes in habitat quality. A slight drop in ambient water: they die. A slight increase in acidity in breeding ponds: they die.\nAny animal that has a relatively short life span can be considered an indicator as subtle changes in the environmental quality will be more easily spotted. You can’t wait around to see how small changes affect long-living species.\nWhat's the significance of the discovery of three new species of salamander?\nGB: Describing three new species highlights the importance of preserving natural habitats. Natural and diverse habitat types maintain healthy biodiversity. Losing diversity, especially species that occupy key trophic positions such as salamanders, compromises the population health of all species within the community.\nHow often are new species found?\nGB: With modern molecular phylogenetic tools, new species are described frequently. However, the rate of species loss is more troubling. We are losing them faster than we can describe them!\nHow does your research involve salamanders?\nGB: My collaborative research uses salamanders as model predators and wood frog tadpoles as prey species. We are examining the role ecological uncertainty plays in shaping the cognitive ecology of prey and predators. This is a key “missing piece” in our understanding of ecosystem sustainability, made even more important as climate change, invasive species and habitat degradation are all thought to increase the uncertainty.\nLearn more about research in Concordia’s Department of Biology . \n \n"}

The catch? There are worms involved. \nThe study’s lead author, Louise Hénault-Ethier, carried out her research while pursuing a master’s from what is now Concordia’s  Individualized program . She experimented with different methods of vermicomposting to see whether they could sufficiently inactivate certain bacteria for safe public use of the compost. \n“Centralized composting, which is one of the fastest growing industrial composting methods, has strict governmental guidelines, requiring thermal sanitation to prevent the survival of harmful bacteria,” she says.\nThe guidelines require that the compost reaches and maintains a heat of 55 degrees Celsius over a period of three days in a self-heating process driven by decomposer microorganisms found in the compost. \n“But in our case, worms graze on the decomposer community, preventing the onset of high temperatures. We wanted to see if vermicomposting, which proceeds at room temperature could still get rid of harmful bacteria.”\nHénault-Ethier worked with Concordia chemistry professor Yves Gélinas and biology professor  Vincent Martin to examine the impact of vermicomposting on E. coli, a bacteria often found in fecal matter that can easily make its way into organic waste set to be composted. \nThey devised three experiments to monitor the presence of E. coli, testing whether the size of the batch of compost, the amount of naturally occurring compost microbes and the rate at which the compost was fed would affect the survival of the pathogen. \nTime and again, the worms worked their magic and eventually produced compost that respected the regulatory bacterial count limits. When the normal compost microbes or worms were present, E. coli declined more rapidly. Without worms or with sterile compost, it took a little more time to get there.  \n\"We found that the compost batches take on average 18 to 21 days to decrease the E. coli to levels well below the legal limit,” explains Gélinas, who worked closely with Hénault-Ethier to examine how the chemicals, such as Carbon, Nitrogen or sugars, present in the compost materials would affect the bacteria’s survival.\n“While that's slower than traditional composting methods, it’s not a prohibitive amount of time.\"\n‘Upcycling waste’\nFor Hénault-Ethier, who was recently named head of scientific projects for the David Suzuki Foundation , it’s the added benefits of vermicomposting that are most important, beyond the results of the E. coli survival experiments.\n\"The compost it produces may lead to higher plant yields when used as a fertilizer, and — even more surprising — the red wigglers themselves could then be reused as feed for other animals on the food chain,” she says.\nThis is what's called “upcycling” — generating something more valuable than the initial waste product.\nAlthough the idea of using invertebrates as animal feed may seem a little strange, it’s actually a proven method for potentially replacing the resource-intensive soybeans or fish meal traditionally used. \n\"This study suggests that upcycling technologies like vermicomposting can be more widely developed for commercial use,” says Hénault-Ethier. As a past environmental coordinator for Concordia, she spearheaded a large-scale worm-farming project in which 15 tons of the university’s waste were composted per year.\n“Though traditional compost can rapidly kill potential pathogens through heat, industrial composting may actually take longer to reach maturity than vermicomposting. Why not wait a little longer to see pathogen declines in vermicomposting and then create a product that provides nutrient-rich feed to both plants and animals? It's a win-win situation.\"\nThe results show that vermicomposting is a promising method in the sanitation of organic waste, which would allow for producing proteins for animal feed.\nThat said, while the E. coli inactivation observed in the current study is promising, Hénault-Ethier cautions that further research on a more diverse array of pathogens is still required.\n"}

Currently, we are focused on several interconnected research themes:\nMonitoring, modeling and predicting microbial community dynamics. A general goal in microbial ecology is to predict the response of microbial systems to external disturbances, for example, a warming climate. Currently, predictions are hindered by an incomplete understanding of how environmental and biotic factors influence microbial community structure and function. In the Walsh lab, we are using the coastal ocean as a model ecosystem in which to advance microbial ecology towards a predictive science. We are monitoring the composition of microbial assemblages in relation to a long-term, high resolution oceanographic time-series of abiotic and biotic conditions at a temperate coastal ocean observatory. Through repeated observation over multiple years, we are identifying re-occurring patterns in microbial genetic and functional diversity that will inform the construction of ecological models of coastal microbial systems.\nReconciling diversity: organic matter and microbial communities. Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration. Although a natural phenomenon, evidence points to human-driven expansion of hypoxia in both the coastal and open ocean. Oxygen depletion in the open ocean is intensifying, potentially driven by current climate trends. Similarly, excess nutrient input from industrial and agricultural activities are leading to an increase in the number of coastal hypoxic regions. We are investigating the causes and consequences of marine hypoxia from a microbial ecology perspective by studying microbial communities associated with hypoxic bottom waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and several coastal marine basins.\nCauses and consequences of marine hypoxia.\nOxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration.

The rates are primarily based on past use of the benefit by the participants in the plan.\nIn August 2016, you were notified that the premium rates for the 2016-2017 benefit year would be increasing, for the first time in four (4) years, by 20%.\nAt its November 2016 meeting, the Board of Governors approved a motion that the University will absorb the cost of the increase to Health Plan premiums for the 2016-2017 benefit year.\nThe change in the premium rates will be implemented on pay issued December 9, 2016. This means that those who have not paid the 2016-2017 premium rates in full will see a reduction in the rates for the balance of the year. For those who have paid in full, either through payroll deduction or by cheque, they will have the amount equal to the incremental increase in the health plan premium reimbursed on pay issued December 9, 2016.\nPlease bear in mind that in accordance with taxation laws, health plan premiums paid by the employer are taxable benefits. The incremental cost of the health care premiums absorbed by the University for the 2016-2017 benefit year will be an additional taxable benefit for employees. This additional amount will be included on the tax slips for 2016.\nFor questions related to health benefits, please contact Human Resources at: 514-848-2424 ext. 3666 or at: benefits@concordia.ca\nRelated Links\n"}

In one program, we investigate cell cycle control and development in Candida albicans, one of the most common fungal pathogens of humans. C. albicans differentiates into several cell types, including yeast, pseudohyphae or hyphae. This trait is crucial for virulence; cells locked in one form are significantly less pathogenic. Cell cycle signals have profound effects on differentiation and polar morphogenesis in C. albicans, but the basic cell cycle circuitry and mechanisms linking it with development are not well defined. We specifically investigate regulatory aspects of the G1/S transition, mitosis and polar morphogenesis. Our work revealed distinct features that have important implications for new drug target discovery and controlling growth of the pathogen. In a second program, we focus on the roles of a polo-like kinase, PLKA, in cell cycle regulation and development of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Polo-like kinases are multi-functional cell cycle regulators in yeast to humans, up-regulated in many cancers, and play additional roles in metazoan development. We identified PLKA in A. nidulans, which is the only filamentous fungal polo-like kinase characterized to date, and demonstrated that it has many novel functions, including negatively regulating sexual development. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that filamentous fungal polo-like kinases are a distinct group, which has important implications for the evolution of the polo-like kinase family.\nAccepting graduate students: Please forward a C.V. and provide names of references\nTeaching activities\nBiotechnology and Genomics Lab (Diploma Program in Genomics)\nSelected publications\nMogilevsky,  K.*, Glory, A.* and Bachewich, C.  2012.

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

Limited tolerance to extremes in temperatures, drought, salinity and nutrient imbalances have traditionally restricted the cropping alternatives available to growers and threatened the sustainability of agriculture. Understanding the genetic basis of environmental stress tolerance and genetic improvement of crop species can enhance productivity, expand crop production into previously non-economically viable areas and reduce the need for expensive inputs with possible environmentally damaging consequences. Many plant species show remarkable tolerance to environmental stresses, including high salinity, drought and temperatures below -20°C. The molecular analysis of the plant's response to drought, salt stress, and freezing have shown that there is a large number of genes that are up-regulated in response to these stresses. Some of stress-responsive genes are regulated by common signalling pathways that act in response to different stresses and others are regulated by pathways that are unique to specific stresses. Many of the stress-regulated genes are themselves regulatory genes. We study the adaptation to environmental stress in wheat, Triticum aestivum, one of the most important crops world-wide. We carry out both molecular analysis of stress-regulated genes and genomic analysis of the stress response for large-scale gene discovery. Our current work focuses on signalling pathways that are mediated by the interaction of GTP binding proteins (G proteins), calcium binding proteins and phospholipase C's. These stress regulated genes encoding these proteins initially were discovered in wheat, and in a closely related and highly salt-tolerant wild wheatgrass Lophopyrum elongatum. To further characterize the effects of these genes on plant growth and resistance to environmental stress we characterize the homologs of the cereal genes in Arabidopsis lines in which the genes have been mutated or over-expressed.\nOur second major area of research is in genomic research of wheat and closely related species in the tribe Triticeae. We characterize expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from large-scale first and second generation sequencing of cDNA. Gene discovery is directed toward the identification of signalling and regulatory genes whose expression is induced or repressed by environmental stress and the characterization of homeologous gene expression in polyploidy plants.\nTeaching activities\nMolecular and General Genetics\nSelected publications\nKhalil, H.B., Brunetti, S.C., Pham, U.M., Maret, D., Laroche, A., Gulick, P.J.

The aims of my research are focused upon using techniques in synthetic biology as a means of exploiting enzymes, developing them as tools in industrial biocatalysis, as well as targeting them within pathogenic microbes to disable them with specific inhibitor drugs as therapeutics to treat infectious diseases.\nEnzyme engineering\nUsing techniques like directed evolution, we can engineer enzymes to optimize them towards our desired activities by mimicking the natural selection process in the laboratory. To this end we are pursuing research towards discovering and engineering enzyme biocatalysts for the production of anticancer anthracycline glycoside drugs and other therapeutic drugs from the same class of natural products for use in a wide range of health applications. We also aim to establish, using synthetic biology, new methods for producing biorenewable hydrocarbons as alternatives to petroleum products and to engineer, through directed evolution, efficient enzyme biocatalysts for doing so.\nScreening enzyme inhibitors as antimicrobial drugs\nWe aim to develop and apply high-throughput enzyme activity-based methods for discovering drugs against Mycobacteria tuberculosis using an in vitro reconstituted biosynthetic pathway of mycobacterial cell wall components by which to assay enzyme inhibitors.\nOpportunities\nStudents interested in research positions in our lab, please email a C.V. and provide the names and contact information of references\nPublications\nKwan, D.H., Jin, Y., Jiang, J., Chen, H.M., Kötzler, M.P., Overkleeft, H.S., Davies, G.J., and Withers, S.G.

Microorganisms, in particular fungi, are efficient decomposers of plant biomass. They produce extracellular enzymes to breakdown plant biomass. We use genomic and ancillary approaches to identify novel enzymes involved in lignocellulose hydrolysis. Our research includes: 1) sequencing and analysis of thermophilic fungi and wood-rotting fungi; 2) examine the transcriptome and exo-proteome profiles of these fungi to identify promising lignocellulolytic proteins; 3) produce recombinant proteins using the industrial workhorse Aspergillus niger; 4) determine the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzymes; and 5) in collaboration with industrial and government partners, test the enzymes for industrial and environmental applications. Data management and development of computational tools are integral parts of our research. Other research interests include biocuration, phylogenomics, developmental of sustainable biotechnology and cell differentiation.\nSelected publications\nBadhan A, Jin L, Wang Y, Han S, Kowalczys K, Brown DC, Ayala CJ, Latoszek-Green M, Miki B, Tsang A, McAllister T.

First, our laboratory is investigating biochemical and molecular aspects of the sulfonation reaction in relation to plant growth, development and adaptation to stress using Arabidopsis thaliana sulfotransferases as a model system. To date, we have characterized two sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of brassinosteroids and hydroxylated derivatives of jasmonic acid, respectively. The biochemical function and the pattern of expression of these enzymes suggest that plants like mammals use the sulfonation reaction to modulate the biological activity of hormones and chemical messengers. Our second axis of research is the study of the structure function relationship of sulfotransferases in order to elucidate the mechanism of sulfonate transfer and to define the amino acids responsible for substrate binding and catalysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, we mapped several amino acids required for catalysis and cosubstrate binding while the construction of chimeric proteins allowed to define the domain responsible for substrate specificity.\nTeaching activities\n"}

Currently, we are focused on several interconnected research themes:\nMonitoring, modeling and predicting microbial community dynamics. A general goal in microbial ecology is to predict the response of microbial systems to external disturbances, for example, a warming climate. Currently, predictions are hindered by an incomplete understanding of how environmental and biotic factors influence microbial community structure and function. In the Walsh lab, we are using the coastal ocean as a model ecosystem in which to advance microbial ecology towards a predictive science. We are monitoring the composition of microbial assemblages in relation to a long-term, high resolution oceanographic time-series of abiotic and biotic conditions at a temperate coastal ocean observatory. Through repeated observation over multiple years, we are identifying re-occurring patterns in microbial genetic and functional diversity that will inform the construction of ecological models of coastal microbial systems.\nReconciling diversity: organic matter and microbial communities. Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration. Although a natural phenomenon, evidence points to human-driven expansion of hypoxia in both the coastal and open ocean. Oxygen depletion in the open ocean is intensifying, potentially driven by current climate trends. Similarly, excess nutrient input from industrial and agricultural activities are leading to an increase in the number of coastal hypoxic regions. We are investigating the causes and consequences of marine hypoxia from a microbial ecology perspective by studying microbial communities associated with hypoxic bottom waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and several coastal marine basins.\nCauses and consequences of marine hypoxia.\nOxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration.

At the same time, parasites are organisms in their own right and are subject to many of the same environmental pressures that affect free living organisms. Research in this laboratory is focussed primarily on the trematode (fluke) and cestode (tapeworm) parasites of aquatic birds. Our approach is mainly ecological in it's perspective and involves studies the effects of temporal and spatial parameters on parasite communities in wild ducks, gulls and coots. The most recent study is on the seasonal dynamics of parasites in eider ducks in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. In addition to studies on the parasites in birds, we also work on projects that explore various aspects of parasite life cycles, seasonal dynamics of parasites in snail and arthropod intermediate hosts and on host-parasite relations between parasite larvae and the intermediate hosts. This has included studies on the seasonal transmission of two trematodes (Cyclocoelum and Diplostomum ) in laboratory and natural conditions and aspects of the host parasite -relationship between cestode larvae and crustacean intermediate hosts. Because birds are hosts to a tremendous diversity of parasitic worms, a significant part of the work in this laboratory involves the identification of parasite species. While much of this is done using traditional morphological methods, we also use molecular methods in studies designed to clarify relationships between morphologically similar species, to identify potentially pathogenic parasite larvae and to investigate the phylogenetic history of members of selected families of cyclophyllidean cestodes.\nSelected publications\nDesilets, H.

Prior to this he held his first post doctoral fellowship at the August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), where he also taught in the Department of Cell Biology. He received a PhD in Medical Physiology from Lund University (Sweden) and has a strong background in molecular biology and protein chemistry after studies at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund University (MSc., Chemical Engineering).\nEducation\nPhD (Lund University), MSc (Lund University)\nResearch interests\nThe main research interests in Dr Bergdahl’s lab lies in studies of the blood vessel wall with a focus on understanding this system during physiologically stressful situations like exercise as well as pathophysiological conditions. The differentiation and functional properties of smooth muscle cells depend on the cellular environment, and any disturbance of this, such as endothelial damage, inflammation or lipid retention will lead to reactions that can initiate atherosclerotic lesions. Dr Bergdahl study mechanisms involved in these processes by using state-of-the-art techniques including electrophysiology, isometric force measurements, functional proteomics, molecular genetics and advanced imaging. The overriding goal is to define conditions that are essential for the normal function and cell differentiation in the vascular wall and to translate these findings from the basic understanding and experimental animal research into clinical understanding of integrative cardiovascular control in health and disease. This is hoped to generate new therapeutic approaches which in the future might lead to better prevention of vascular disease.\nTeaching activities\n"}

We are in the midst of a scientific revolution; major discoveries continue to be made that change the way we think about traditional scientific subjects. By using a combination of traditional and outside-the-box teaching methods I try to inspire students to learn not just for the sake of learning but because they are inspired by the material. My lectures aim to blend ‘textbook facts’ with new information. In this way the students will leave Concordia with a cutting edge knowledge base and way of thinking that will help them succeed in whatever endeavor they pursue.”\nCourses taught\nEXCI461 Pharmacology for Sport and Exercise\nEXCI257 Physiology (Endocrinology)\nResearch activities\nCurrent research projects\nOur research area is immunology, with an emphasis on how the immune system and autonomic nervous system communicate with each other. The main project called \"Hormonal regulation of T cell Genomics.\", is meant to investigate how the catecholamine hormone receptors (e.g. beta2-adrenergic receptor) influence T lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Other hormones of interest include thyroid hormones and cortisol. A second project called \"Human variations in sympathetic nervous system response.\" was recently launched to address the hypothesis that human autonomic traits are distributed around two theoretical groupings. For this project, human subjects listen to dissonant music or undergo cold exposure to induce autonomic reactions. A third initiative is in development to investigate the impact of sodium on T lymphocyte responses in people. Dr. Darlington always encourages students to develop and pursue their own research interests within the themes of immunology and autonomic nervous system. The research happens in Canada at the PERFORM Centre and the Center for Structural and Functional Genomics at the Loyola Campus in NDG, Montreal, Quebec. \nPublications\nSelected publications\n1.      A.

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.
