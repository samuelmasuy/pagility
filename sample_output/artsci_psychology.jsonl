Latimer\n“The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start.” | Photo by Woodleywonderworks (Flickr CC)\nIs everyone ready to get an extra hour of sleep this weekend?\nAt 2 a.m. this Sunday morning, November 6, we will return to standard time by moving our clocks back one hour.\nThis change happens annually on the first Sunday in November — unless you live in most of Saskatchewan, Southampton Island in Nunavut or small pockets of Northwestern Ontario, Quebec or BC.\nThese regions of Canada never opted into Daylight Saving Time (DST), although other cities and regions were using DST as early as 1918.\nSpring forward, fall back\n“The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start,” says Nuria de Zavalia, a research associate who works with Shimon Amir , a psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia.\nIt's like jet lag, she adds, explaining that alterations in the circadian system can affect alertness, mood, stress hormone levels, memory formation, cognitive performance, metabolism, cardiovascular system and, especially, depression.\n“Daylight Saving Time does not help people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder , for example,” says de Zavalia. “And research has shown that the Monday after the time change — especially in the spring, when we have one hour less sleep — there is an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and depressive episodes .”\nSo, what can be done to lessen the effects of returning to standard time?\n“Start early,” says de Zavalia. “If you can change the clocks a few days early, in 10-minute increments instead of a full hour in one shot, it’ll be easier on your system.”\n"}

{"url": "http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/programs/graduate/faq.html", "field": "artsci_psychology", "title": "Graduate Admission FAQ", "text": "Prerequisite Courses for the MA Program in Psychology (Research & Clinical Training Option)\nI want to be a Psychologist!\n....but I don’t think I meet the requirements of having “an Honours Undergraduate degree in Psychology (BA or BSc) with a high GPA” that is required for application to the graduate program in Psychology. What are my options?\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about admission to our graduate program in Clinical Psychology\nQ. I primarily want to be a Clinical Psychologist. What are the other local opportunities to develop the type of career that I want?\nA. There are many different graduate programs that allow one to have a career as a psychologist or therapist. Some local universities offer a Psy.D. in Psychology (e.g. psy.umontreal.ca/programmes-­et-­cours/cycles-­superieurs/doctorat‐en-­psychologie‐clinique/ ). This is a doctoral degree in Psychology that does not require the research component of a Ph.D. thesis. Other graduate programs include Counselling Psychology (e.g. www.mcgill.ca/edu‐ecp/), and Art, Drama or Music Therapy (e.g. creativeartstherapies.concordia.ca/ ). Different programs may or may not have the strict research pre-­requisites and heavy research component that are required for an M.A./Ph.D. Program in Clinical Psychology.\nQ. What are my chances of being accepted into the graduate “Research and Clinical Training Option” in Psychology at Concordia?\nA. Although we receive hundreds of applications from highly qualified honours students, we are only able to accept 11 new clinical students each year. Students that do not have a conventional honours undergraduate degree in psychology or its equivalent, or who have not completed an empirical research thesis as part of their undergraduate studies, can sometimes be at a further disadvantage.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist, but I don’t have an undergraduate degree in Psychology. What are my options?\nA. Due to our accreditation from the CPA and APA, we require certain pre-requisite psychology course competencies prior to entrance into the graduate program. You can enrol in a university undergraduate psychology program and complete these courses ‐ as listed in our honours degree equivalency checklist. If you already have a BA or BSc degree, you do not need to complete a second degree in psychology, merely the pre-requisite courses.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but it isn’t an honours degree. What are my options?\nA. This presents a little more of a problem. If you already have an undergraduate degree in psychology, you cannot enrol in a second undergraduate psychology degree program. You can enrol as an independent student in some cases, but many universities, including Concordia, restrict the higher level psychology courses to psychology majors. Thus, you may not have access to the courses you need when enrolled as an independent student. Some universities, including McGill, offer a special status student program to make up for any course deficiencies for graduate school ( www.psych.mcgill.ca/grad/program/application_admission.htm ). At the present time, Concordia does not have a qualifying program for this purpose.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but my grades are below what is required (minimum GPA of 3.5/4.3). What are my options?\nA. Grades aren’t the only factor taken into account when considering an applicant for graduate school. For example research experience is weighed very heavily. However, this particular program is very competitive and the odds of someone with a low GPA being accepted into the clinical program are very low. Some students feel that taking a few more courses and getting better grades will help. Usually a few courses will not have a great impact on the overall GPA and all courses are weighted equally during our admissions process.\nQ. I don’t have an Honours Psychology degree, but I have lots of work experience in counselling and/or therapy. Can my work experience be considered for my application instead of university courses or research experience?\nA. Our graduate program is heavily based upon the research-practitioner model. It is assumed that counselling/therapy skills will be taught once in the program so they are not a pre-requisite for entry into the program. Thus, pre-requisite coursework and research experience are considered most important for our admissions process and prior counselling experience cannot replace those.\nQ. If I apply to the graduate Psychology Program (Research Option) and I am accepted to that program, can I later switch to the Research and Clinical Option?\nA. No. If a student is accepted into the graduate program, “Research Option” they are not eligible to later apply to the “Research and Clinical Training Option”.\nChecklist 1\nPrerequisite Courses for the MA Program in Psychology, (Research Training Option)\nAn honours undergraduate degree in Psychology, or its equivalent, is required for the Research Training Option.

The master's degree requires a minimum of one year of full-time study and involves - in addition to the thesis - course work in psychological theory and advanced statistics, seminars in the student's area of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes), and directed teaching in our undergraduate program. The doctoral program involves similar advanced training: independent research; supervised reading, research and course work in subject matter and methods in the area of research specialization; program-wide research and methods seminars; and teaching experience. Doctoral studies require a minimum of two years of full-time study.\nResearch\nStudents are provided the resources to conduct research throughout their graduate education. All new students are accepted into our program by a faculty member who is willing to provide supervision and financial support. Thus, each student is associated with a research team comprised of faculty and graduate students. Research teams within the department are organized around four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes) and pursue a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) appetitive motivation and drug dependence, problems in human development, cognitive and perceptual processes, and anxiety disorders.\nBecause entering students have often had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, students who complete the Ph.D. degree achieve a high level of research specialization and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, most students have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences. There are several sources of funding within the Department for student travel to scientific conferences. Also, students are expected to publish articles on their research in scientific journals.\nExamples of recent student publications\nTrewartha, K. M., Endo, A., Li, K. Z. H., & Penhune, V. B. (2009).

Thus, students have ample opportunity to interact with their supervisor and other faculty and students of their research teams.\n"}
{"url": "http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/programs/graduate/research-clinical-training.html", "field": "artsci_psychology", "title": "Research & clinical training option", "text": "GooglePlus\nResearch & clinical training option\nThe research and clinical training option is based on the scientist-practitioner model.That is, clinical students fulfill the same research requirements as other students, but they also receive professional training in the delivery of psychological services. The program's goal is to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists who not only conduct research and contribute to the scientific base of the discipline but who are also competent mental health professionals. Because research is such an important part of our program, students seeking only professional training or who do not intend to continue to the PhD degree should apply elsewhere.\nOverview\nStudents with BA or BSc degrees begin their studies in the first year of the research and clinical training option, which includes course work in psychological theory and research design, clinical theory and practice, and a master's thesis. Students enroll in the MA in Psychology and the Diploma in Clinical Psychology. The MA portion of the research and clinical training option requires a minimum of one year of full time study, the Diploma an additional 8 months.\nFollowing successful completion of the master's thesis and courses, students continue doctoral studies, in which they receive advanced training in research methods, psychological theory, and clinical practice. Besides continuous involvement in research in one of the department's four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, and Human Development and Developmental Processes) during their training, students also conduct a doctoral thesis, which must be a substantive piece of original research. The doctoral program requires a minimum of two years of full-time study. Following their doctoral thesis research, students complete a one-year, full-time internship in a clinic or hospital setting. \nOur clinical psychology program has been accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association since 1986 and by the Ordre des psychologues du Québec since 2004.\nThe Canadian Psychological Association requires disclosure of information on the applicant pool, acceptance rates, diversity, graduates, and other details about our programme. This information can be found here .\nFor more details on the policies and procedures of the clinical program please refer to the policies and procedures manual .\n \nAccreditation Panel of the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA)\n141 Laurier Ave. West, Suite 702\nOttawa, Ontario K1P 5J3\nOrdre des Psychologues du Québec (OPQ)\n1100 Beaumont avenue, suite 510\nMont-Royal, Québec H3P 3H5\nPhilosophy & mission\nOur program adheres to the Boulder scientist-practitioner model of training. This means that we strongly endorse the principle that a scientist-practitioner has a research orientation to his/her practice, and we encourage clinical relevance in research. Our model encompasses learning and career pathways individually tailored to student interest and faculty expertise. This permits a wide range of research emphases including those of basic research, while at the same time placing the highest value on the close integration of science and practice. The principal objective of our program is to produce graduates who have the necessary skills to function as researchers and as practitioners, who may function as either or both, and who meet the highest standards in the science and practice of psychology.\nProgram goals & outcomes\nOur program adheres to the Accreditation Criteria and Principles of the Canadian and American Psychological Associations and the Ordre des psychologues du Québec in its specific goals for clinical training. The principal objective is that a graduate of our program be\ncapable of functioning as an investigator and as a practitioner, and may function as either or both, consistent with the highest standards in psychology (Belar & Perry, 1992, p. 72).\nOur specific objectives include that our graduates:\nBe capable of conducting and publishing high quality psychological research in domains that have the potential to enhance the practice of psychology.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the theoretical and empirical roots in psychology of both clinical research and practice, and of current relevant developments in other areas of specialization in psychology.\nDemonstrate specialized knowledge of the major theoretical, methodological, and empirical work in clinical psychology, with both adults and children.\nBe capable of implementing theory-based, research-supported clinical practice, including assessment and treatment, with both adults and children.\nDemonstrate ethical and professional awareness and conduct in both their practice and their research.\nBe competent in dealing with individual and cultural diversity in values, beliefs and customs.\nBe capable of communicating knowledge to others.\nBe capable of consulting effectively with other professions, clients, and organizations.\nBe familiar with models of supervision, and competent in the supervision of other professionals.\nFunctions for which students are prepared\nStudents in our program receive the necessary academic, scientific, and clinical training so that they may contribute to psychological science and clinical practice in significant ways upon graduation.\nOur goal is to produce clinical psychologists who are highly trained in both the science of psychology and the methods of clinical practice, and who embody the roles of both researcher and clinical practitioner.\nGraduates of our program go on to careers in clinical and/or academic psychology in settings including hospitals, universities, health care clinics, and private practice.  Their activities are diverse and can include assessment, therapy, intervention, research, teaching, consultation, supervision and/or program planning in a wide variety of client populations.\n"}

You may select either the Major, Honours or Specialization . You can opt for the Bachelor of Arts (BA) or the Bachelor of Science (BSc) , which requires electives in the science.\nAre you a student registered in another department? You can add a minor in Psychology to complement your degree.\nWhat's more, Psychology BSc students may complete a Specialization or Honours in  Behavioural Neuroscience . \nBA or BSc?\nWhat is the difference between a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Science (BSc)?\nMost students will have to complete 90 credits to earn a Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Most courses are worth three or six credits. Therefore, to complete a Bachelor's degree one would have to complete the equivalent of 30, three credit courses. If you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream.\nIn terms of your Psychology courses, there is no difference between the BA degree and the BSc. The difference comes in the electives. Science students will select a number of their electives from the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics) while Arts student will select primarily from the arts and humanities.\nA science background is required for students contemplating careers in neuroscience and it may be an asset in applying for medical school.\nMajor, Specialization, or Honours\nWhat is the difference between Major, Specialization, and Honours?\nIf you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream. The minor is available to students majoring in a subject other than Psychology.\nThe Major consists of 42 credits in Psychology and is relevant for someone seeking a good general degree which could have applications in a variety of fields related to teaching, business, personnel, or community involvement.\nThe Specialization consists of 60 credits in Psychology and as a more concentrated program is appropriate for someone with career plans in an area involving Psychology. It can prepare students for employment in such areas as those listed above for the Major but is recognized as a more intensive degree. Depending on the selection of courses the Specialization may also provide a background for graduate work such as a Master’s degree in counselling Psychology, or social work, or even in an MBA program.\nThe Honours degree is the most intensive of all consisting of 66 credits of Psychology and including two Honours seminars and an Honours thesis in the last year. At least partly because of these courses this program gives the best preparation for admission to graduate school. Admission to Honours is by application and normally occurs after a student’s first 30 credits have been completed with a GPA of 3.5. Students may apply to the Honours program directly from CEGEP if they have a CRC of at least 28.\n"}

By using photographs and video of natural scenes, my aim is to isolate what properties of an image do we use to recognize and classify the type of scene we are viewing, and how do changes in these properties alter our perception of the image. This research employed traditional techniques such as psychophysics and eye tracking, as well as new techniques such as computational neuroscience, gaze-contingent stimuli modifications, augmented virtual reality, as well as studying the underlying neural activity using EEG. My research  also focuses on how various visual (e.g., macular degeneration), cognitive  (e.g., stress, dual-tasking), and the loss of other senses (e.g., hearing loss) effect the visual system, and in particular, eye movements.

First, the hippocampus and other nearby cortical areas are thought to integrate sensory inputs into a cohesive representation. Then, memory is stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. A major mechanism through which circuits of the brain can learn is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My lab examines how changes in synaptic strength occur in parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat. Electrophysiological recording techniques are used to monitor synaptic strength and to examine how neuromodulatory systems (cholingergic, dopaminergic) and rhythmic EEG activities control changes in how neurons interact with one another.\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students make important contributions to this research.

Recent work has explored differences between Chinese and Euro-Canadians in the presentation of depression, using cross-national and acculturation designs in student, community, and clinical samples. Once cultural differences are identified, the emphasis is on why these differences occurred; the potential role of the self-concept is central to these efforts.

In general, my therapeutic orientation in both these areas is cognitive behavioral. One area of interest is adult psychopathology involving a variety of problems including the anxiety disorders (e.g. agoraphobia, panic, social phobia, simple phobia), depression, couples with marital problems, assertiveness issues, and social skills training. Another area of interest is in adult health psychology. This involves the treatment of physical illness and related psychological problems.

As a scientist-practitioner, I take an evidence-based approach, meaning that specific interventions are informed both by the published literature and by evidence obtained over the course of a specific case (e.g., assessments, mood diaries, observation). My clinical interests are assessment and treatment of anxiety, depression, and personality/interpersonal problems.\nLISA SERBIN, Director of Clinical Training, Member of  CRDH ,  Research Interests\nMy research and clinical interests focus on developmental psychopathology and children's health. Specifically, I am interested in disorders of childhood, and in the environmental and social contexts in which children's development takes place. My clinical supervision focuses on the assessment and treatment of children referred for learning, emotional, social and behavioral problems. The focus is on the child, the family, and the environment (including daycare, school, and home settings). Assessment and treatment typically focus on the development of age-appropriate social and cognitive skills, as well as on emotional, behavioral and family problems, with treatment modality determined by the needs of the case. In recent years children have been seen under my supervision for problems including learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, behavior and attentional disorders, conduct disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Students under my direction have learned to use cognitive-behavioral therapy, play therapy, crisis management, and family therapy approaches, and to integrate these diverse theoretical models in developing effective strategies for intervention.\nDALE STACK,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests\nMy clinical experience is in the area of assessment and treatment of difficulties that occur in children (and their families).    My particular focus is working with very young children (preschoolers) and their families.   This area encompasses a range of problems including (but not limited to) developmental delays, expressive and/or receptive language delays, pervasive developmental disorders, behavior problems, sensory and physical disabilities, adjustment difficulties, child management and parenting, and family issues.   My general approach is cognitive-behavioral.   I underscore the importance of comprehensive assessment and I utilize alternative assessment procedures when valuable (e.g., non-verbal, non-compliant, etc.,).   Given the age range of the children, my clinical work involves direct contact with the child and his/her parent(s)/caregivers (and family).\n \nClinical Supervisors (External)\nSome of the clinicians who have recently supervised clinical students from Concordia (as a primary or case supervisor) on a clinical practicum or internship in  external settings  are:\nPerry Adler, Mélanie Archambault, Susan Barza, Jeanne Beaudry, Karina Béland, Claude Bélanger, Nathalie Belda, Sophie Bergeron, Johan Binette, Irv Binik, Caminee Blake, Hildegard Brack, William Brender, Sophie Brière, Thomas Brown, Ken Bruce, Christiane Chalfoun, Tinaz Chinoy, Rebecca Cohen, Lois Colle, Mike Coward, Fern Cramer-Azima, Sylvie Daigneault, David D’Alessandro, Elaine De Guise, Paule Delisle, Mary DeRemer, Nathalie Desormeaux, Louise Dessertine, Nathalie Dinh, Marc Simon Drouin, Lucie Fortin, Hallie Frank, Danny Gagnon, Ann Gamsa, Carole Gendron, Marc-André Généreux, Constantina Giannopoulos, Sylvie Goulet, Judy Gradinger, Rachel Green, Linda Greenberg, Pierre Grégoire, Corinne Gutman, Esther Handelman, Karen Hardoon, Geneviève Janveau-Brennan, Martin Jodoin-St-Onge, Jasmine Joncas, Marilyn Jonesgotman, Dennis Kalogeropoulos, Felicia Kaufman, Leslie Klein, Nathan Kuperstok, Constance Lalinec-Michaud, Henry Lavigueur, François Lefebvre, Judith Le Gallais, Gabriel Leonard, Stephanie Leonard, Nathalie Liboiron, Robert Loveless, Solange Marchildon, Suzanne Marcotte, Stephanie Margolese, Chantale Martel, Valentin Mbekou, Muriel Michel, Daniel Moisan, Linda Moxley-Haegert, Carolyn Nelham, Sylvain Néron, Margaret O’Byrne, Zbigniew Pleszewski, Nancy Poirier, Cecile Quirouette, Sandra Rafman, Maria Ramsay, Christina Saltaris, Liliane Sayegh, Miriam Scherer Berkovic, Alessandra Schiavetto, Connie Scuccimarri, Monique Séguin, Esther Sidoli-Leblanc, Maxine Sigman, Thérèse Simard, David Sinyor, Liliane Spector, Dale Stack, Julie St-Amand, Chantal Ste-Marie, Guylaine St-Pierre, Maria Sufrategui, Angeles Toharia, Mary Tsonis, Julie Vachon, Monica Chantal Vasquez, Deborah Weissberg Morrison, Ruta Westreich, Anne Wittevrongel, Sepi Zargarpour, Phyllis Zelkowitz.\nProfiles of Clinical Faculty\nLUCIE BONNEVILLE\nMy clinical interests are in several areas such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety and psychotic symptoms.  My orientation is eclectic.  In general, I use techniques from the models of Humanistic, Psychodynamic, Existential and Cognitive therapies in short and long term psychotherapy with adults and late adolescence.\nSAM BURSTEIN, Clinical Psychologist at the Montreal Children’s Hospital and in private practice. \nMy clinical experience lies mainly in the area of working with children and their families, wherein the presenting concern is child-related.

Normal aging is often accompanied by declines in brain function that can harm the quality of life of seniors. However, not all people are affected in the same way and not all brain functions decline at the same speed. Louis Bherer and his team want to improve understanding of why and how intellectual stimulation and physical activity can help seniors maintain better brain functioning. He's also exploring whether these benefits are long lasting and are similar for seniors of all ages, sexes and health conditions.\nSelected publications\nBherer, L.

By participating in research, these students have the opportunity to gain a better appreciation of psychological testing and experimentation. However, as there are potential risks associated with classroom recruitment and student testing, these guidelines are intended to facilitate the collection of participants and/or data in undergraduate classroom settings at Concordia University, while protecting the rights of student research participants.\nApproaching the Instructor\nThe instructor should be provided with the following information well in advance of the classroom visit:\nWho is supervising the project.\nWhen the recruiter would prefer to visit the class.\nHow long the class visit will take.\nThe nature of the recruitment (sign up sheet, screening questionnaire, etc.)\nWhat (if any) testing will occur at the time of recruitment.\nRecruiting in Class\nWhen the recruiter visits the classroom, the following information should be provided to the students:\nThe name of the recruiter(s) and the faculty member(s) supervising the project.\nContact information for the lab(s) in which the study is being conducted.\nWhat the study is meant to investigate.\nThe nature of the study (questionnaire based, interview based, brief description of experimental tasks, etc.).\nThe amount of time required to participate in the study.\nWhat compensation (if any) participants will receive for their time.\nWhen the study is being conducted (Are appointments set?, Can students drop by the lab?, etc.).\nStudent should be informed that the data that they may provide during the course of their participation are completely unrelated to their required coursework or grade.\nThat participation is completely voluntary and that participants can refuse or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences whatsoever.\nThe nature and/or limits of confidentiality in the study. Ideally, the recruiter should leave the room while sign up sheets and/or questionnaires are being completed so that students will be free to either participate or decline to participate.\nTesting in Class\nDue to the possible demands produced by testing in groups, in the presence of experimenters and/or in the presence of course instructors, testing in classrooms is discouraged.\nIf in-class testing is deemed to be essential, the following measures (in addition to the above 10 points) should be taken to protect students from coercion and to ensure the confidentiality of their participation:\nParticipants should be told that their results will not be made available to their instructor.\nParticipants who choose not to participate should not be separated or otherwise identified during classroom testing. (This may be accomplished by distributing packages to all students in the class and then stating that students are free to either spoil the materials or leave them blank before returning them.)\nIn addition to written debriefing (see below), students should receive a brief oral debriefing in class about the purpose of the study.\nDebriefing\nAll experimental and study participants have the right to be debriefed from psychological studies. In order to facilitate both a greater understanding of research in psychology and to provide other sources of related information about the study, student participants should receive a brief written debriefing sheet (less than one half page) upon completion of the study.\nThe debriefing sheet should contain the following information:\nThe name of the study, the experimenter(s) and the faculty supervisor(s).\nThe telephone and other contact information for the lab(s) in which the study was conducted as well as contact information for the University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Psychology Department Ethics Committee.\n*The nature of the study (hypotheses, goals, etc.).\n*Some information about the design of the study (groups, measures, etc.).\nA brief statement about the importance or implications of the study.\nCitation of one or two suggested articles or book chapters for further reading.\n*If the study involves deception, it is acceptable for items 3 and 4 to be somewhat vague when distributed in written form, provided that a full oral debriefing is given to each participant. Ideally, this sheet will be accompanied by a brief oral debriefing period in which the above are explained to the student participant.\nDebriefing\nAll experimental and study participants have the right to be debriefed from psychological studies.

In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.\nFunding: My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Fonds de la recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQ-S), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Concordia University.\nCurrent graduate students: Franca Lacroix, Atyeh Heidari-Jam, Milan Valyear and Franz Villaruel\nResearch Assistants: Melanie Chahine, Sabrina Heffernan\nChaudhri lab, 2013\nBiography\nDr. Chaudhri earned her B.A. in Biological Foundations of Behavior with a concentration in Neuroscience at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA.

Specifically, I examine the effect of social cognition on the development, production, and maintenance of trust and prosocial behaviour. The long-term goal of my research program is to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of trust on human behaviour and development through the utilization of methods and theory from social, cognitive, and evolutionary psychology.\nWork in my lab can broadly be divided into three related lines examining:\nhow children extend trust to others through the production of prosocial behaviours,\nthe development of children's ability to respond to other's displays of trustworthiness through selective social interactions\nindividual difference factors that affect the tendency to extend trust\nEducation\nPhD (Queen's University)\nSelected publications\nWagner, L., Dunfield, K.A. & Rohrbeck, K.L.

In this context, we examine risk and resiliency factors impacting the physiological consequences of cumulative or chronic exposure to social and environmental stressors over the life course, notably depression, rumination, and sleep. We are also interested in identifying neurophysiological indicators of sensitivity to the social environment and vulnerability to stress, with a particular emphasis on oxytocin and heart rate variability. \nCurrent funded studies examine:\n-The impact of chronic stress and interpersonal relationships on depression and systemic inflammation among parents of adolescents and adults with neurodevelopmental disorders during the transition to adulthood. Funded by CIHR.\n-The role of heart rate variability in the impact of chronic parenting stress on marital quality and dyadic coping processes among parents of young children. Funded by SSHRC.\n-The impact of cognitive-behavioural treatment for insomnia on stress-related insomnia, emotion regulation, and inflammation among individuals with primary insomnia and insomnia with comorbid depression.
