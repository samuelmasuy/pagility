London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium.\nConsent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events.\nAt the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained: “We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,” she says.\n“Outreach activities like this are also great opportunities to start important conversations and provide information about consent, bystander intervention and preventing sexual violence.”\n \nLearn more about safe sex by reading Health Service’s 16 Safer Sex Practices .\n \n"}

People don’t judge you.”\nOne hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.\n“Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,” says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit.\nSinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.\n“That was a great email to receive,” says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school. “I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,” she says.\nSinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions. \n“If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,” says Sinzinkayo. “I would like to complete a PhD.”\n“Psychology is a good foundational education.

What are the other local opportunities to develop the type of career that I want?\nA. There are many different graduate programs that allow one to have a career as a psychologist or therapist. Some local universities offer a Psy.D. in Psychology (e.g. psy.umontreal.ca/programmes-­et-­cours/cycles-­superieurs/doctorat‐en-­psychologie‐clinique/ ). This is a doctoral degree in Psychology that does not require the research component of a Ph.D. thesis. Other graduate programs include Counselling Psychology (e.g. www.mcgill.ca/edu‐ecp/), and Art, Drama or Music Therapy (e.g. creativeartstherapies.concordia.ca/ ). Different programs may or may not have the strict research pre-­requisites and heavy research component that are required for an M.A./Ph.D. Program in Clinical Psychology.\nQ. What are my chances of being accepted into the graduate “Research and Clinical Training Option” in Psychology at Concordia?\nA. Although we receive hundreds of applications from highly qualified honours students, we are only able to accept 11 new clinical students each year. Students that do not have a conventional honours undergraduate degree in psychology or its equivalent, or who have not completed an empirical research thesis as part of their undergraduate studies, can sometimes be at a further disadvantage.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist, but I don’t have an undergraduate degree in Psychology. What are my options?\nA. Due to our accreditation from the CPA and APA, we require certain pre-requisite psychology course competencies prior to entrance into the graduate program. You can enrol in a university undergraduate psychology program and complete these courses ‐ as listed in our honours degree equivalency checklist. If you already have a BA or BSc degree, you do not need to complete a second degree in psychology, merely the pre-requisite courses.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but it isn’t an honours degree. What are my options?\nA. This presents a little more of a problem. If you already have an undergraduate degree in psychology, you cannot enrol in a second undergraduate psychology degree program. You can enrol as an independent student in some cases, but many universities, including Concordia, restrict the higher level psychology courses to psychology majors. Thus, you may not have access to the courses you need when enrolled as an independent student. Some universities, including McGill, offer a special status student program to make up for any course deficiencies for graduate school ( www.psych.mcgill.ca/grad/program/application_admission.htm ). At the present time, Concordia does not have a qualifying program for this purpose.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but my grades are below what is required (minimum GPA of 3.5/4.3). What are my options?\nA. Grades aren’t the only factor taken into account when considering an applicant for graduate school. For example research experience is weighed very heavily. However, this particular program is very competitive and the odds of someone with a low GPA being accepted into the clinical program are very low. Some students feel that taking a few more courses and getting better grades will help. Usually a few courses will not have a great impact on the overall GPA and all courses are weighted equally during our admissions process.\nQ. I don’t have an Honours Psychology degree, but I have lots of work experience in counselling and/or therapy. Can my work experience be considered for my application instead of university courses or research experience?\nA. Our graduate program is heavily based upon the research-practitioner model. It is assumed that counselling/therapy skills will be taught once in the program so they are not a pre-requisite for entry into the program. Thus, pre-requisite coursework and research experience are considered most important for our admissions process and prior counselling experience cannot replace those.\nQ. If I apply to the graduate Psychology Program (Research Option) and I am accepted to that program, can I later switch to the Research and Clinical Option?\nA. No. If a student is accepted into the graduate program, “Research Option” they are not eligible to later apply to the “Research and Clinical Training Option”.\nChecklist 1\nPrerequisite Courses for the MA Program in Psychology, (Research Training Option)\nAn honours undergraduate degree in Psychology, or its equivalent, is required for the Research Training Option.

You may select either the Major, Honours or Specialization . You can opt for the Bachelor of Arts (BA) or the Bachelor of Science (BSc) , which requires electives in the science.\nAre you a student registered in another department? You can add a minor in Psychology to complement your degree.\nWhat's more, Psychology BSc students may complete a Specialization or Honours in  Behavioural Neuroscience . \nBA or BSc?\nWhat is the difference between a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Science (BSc)?\nMost students will have to complete 90 credits to earn a Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Most courses are worth three or six credits. Therefore, to complete a Bachelor's degree one would have to complete the equivalent of 30, three credit courses. If you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream.\nIn terms of your Psychology courses, there is no difference between the BA degree and the BSc. The difference comes in the electives. Science students will select a number of their electives from the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics) while Arts student will select primarily from the arts and humanities.\nA science background is required for students contemplating careers in neuroscience and it may be an asset in applying for medical school.\nMajor, Specialization, or Honours\nWhat is the difference between Major, Specialization, and Honours?\nIf you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream. The minor is available to students majoring in a subject other than Psychology.\nThe Major consists of 42 credits in Psychology and is relevant for someone seeking a good general degree which could have applications in a variety of fields related to teaching, business, personnel, or community involvement.\nThe Specialization consists of 60 credits in Psychology and as a more concentrated program is appropriate for someone with career plans in an area involving Psychology. It can prepare students for employment in such areas as those listed above for the Major but is recognized as a more intensive degree. Depending on the selection of courses the Specialization may also provide a background for graduate work such as a Master’s degree in counselling Psychology, or social work, or even in an MBA program.\nThe Honours degree is the most intensive of all consisting of 66 credits of Psychology and including two Honours seminars and an Honours thesis in the last year. At least partly because of these courses this program gives the best preparation for admission to graduate school. Admission to Honours is by application and normally occurs after a student’s first 30 credits have been completed with a GPA of 3.5. Students may apply to the Honours program directly from CEGEP if they have a CRC of at least 28.\n"}

Normal aging is often accompanied by declines in brain function that can harm the quality of life of seniors. However, not all people are affected in the same way and not all brain functions decline at the same speed. Louis Bherer and his team want to improve understanding of why and how intellectual stimulation and physical activity can help seniors maintain better brain functioning. He's also exploring whether these benefits are long lasting and are similar for seniors of all ages, sexes and health conditions.\nSelected publications\nBherer, L.

{"url": "http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/faculty.html?fpid=linda-booij", "field": "artsci_psychology", "title": "Faculty", "text": "linda.booij@concordia.ca\nResearch Interests\nNumerous studies have shown that adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life (e.g., emotional or physical abuse, harsh parenting) can lead to a variety of mental health difficulties later on. These difficulties include (but are not limited to) depression, impulsivity or eating disorders. \nEarly adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life can affect the brain in many different ways; however, the neurotransmitter serotonin is of particular interest. That is because serotonin is (i) widely implicated in a variety of psychopathologies and (ii) important for brain development, especially during infancy or childhood  (i.e., serotonin, in fact, helps to actually “build up the brain”). The overarching theme of our research program is that early adversity could disrupt the stability of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin). This in turn influences the early development of brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and could predispose the individual to psychological problems later in life, particularly when exposed to subsequent stressful events. The studies we are conducting are done in clinical and non-clinical populations and use neuro-imaging (fMRI/PET), epigenetics (DNA methylation) and/or cognitive-behavioural assessments, and is funded by various sources, including CIHR and NARSAD. \nTopics of ongoing research projects include:\n- Impact of childhood trauma on brain processes and (risk for) mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood.\n- Effect of cognitive-behavioural interventions on DNA methylation and brain function in adolescents with depression.\n- DNA methylation, childhood trauma and psychopathology (in particular mood disorders and eating disorders).\n- Impact of peer victimization on brain development and DNA methylation\n- Gene-Environment studies on brain and mental health, using twin designs.\n- Impact of early stress on oral health.\n- Impact of in utero Bisphenol-A (BPA) exposure on brain development in children\nEducation\nPhD (Leiden University, the Netherlands)\nTeaching activities\nPsychopathology: Mood, Anxiety, and Personality Disorders (Psyc 440, winter 2016 and 2017)\nPracticum Neuropsychology (2016-2017)\nPublications\nSelected recent publications\nBooij, L., Welfeld, K., Leyton, M., Dagher, A., Boileau, I., Sibon, I., Baker, G.B.,  Diksic, M., Soucy, J-P., Pruessner, J.C., Cawley – Fiset, E., Casey, K.F., Benkelfat, C.(2016). Dopamine cross-sensitization between psychostimulant drugs and stress in healthy male volunteers. Transl Psychiatry. 2016 Feb 23;6:e740. doi: 10.1038/tp.2016.6.\nChiarella, J., Tremblay, R.E., Szyf, M., Provençal, N., Booij, L.(2015). Impact of Early Environment on Children's Mental Health: Lessons From DNA Methylation Studies With Monozygotic Twins. Twin Res Hum Genet. 2015 Nov 26:1-12.

First, the hippocampus and other nearby cortical areas are thought to integrate sensory inputs into a cohesive representation. Then, memory is stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. A major mechanism through which circuits of the brain can learn is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My lab examines how changes in synaptic strength occur in parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat. Electrophysiological recording techniques are used to monitor synaptic strength and to examine how neuromodulatory systems (cholingergic, dopaminergic) and rhythmic EEG activities control changes in how neurons interact with one another.\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students make important contributions to this research.

My projects are aimed at identifying and measuring the fundamental characteristics of children's interactions and relationships with their peers and determining how these experiences affect behavioral development, emotional adjustment and physical health.   The four current themes of my research projects are (a) contextual/cultural variation in the peer experiences and the processes that account for variations in their effects, (b)  the intersection between peer experiences and psychophysiology especially the response to stress, (c) gene/environment interactions  and gene environment correlations and the long term consequences of peer experiences, and (d) gender differences especially as they are related to culture.\nSelected publications\nBukowski, W.

In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.\nFunding: My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Fonds de la recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQ-S), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Concordia University.\nCurrent graduate students: Franca Lacroix, Atyeh Heidari-Jam, Milan Valyear and Franz Villaruel\nResearch Assistants: Melanie Chahine, Sabrina Heffernan\nChaudhri lab, 2013\nBiography\nDr. Chaudhri earned her B.A. in Biological Foundations of Behavior with a concentration in Neuroscience at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA.
