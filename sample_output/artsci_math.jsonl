The number of awards and the amounts of the individual awards can vary from year to year.\nPreference will be given to candidates who meet some or all of the following criteria:\nHaving a proven interest in the teaching of mathematics at the pre-university level.\nHaving returned to academic study after some interruption.\nHaving overcome some particular handicap or obstacle, e.g. in academic background, physical health, financial security.\nHaving been active as a volunteer in some social, political or professional organization.\nTo be eligible, the applicant must be registered for at least 12 credits in the given academic year.\nApplications must include:\nthe applicant's name, address, social insurance number;\nan up-to-date curriculum vitae;\na statement of purpose indicating in what ways the applicant considers him- or herself worthy of the award (maximum 500 words);\na list of courses the applicant is enrolled in during the current academic year;\na list of any financial support that the applicant is receiving during the current academic year (scholarship, bursary, teaching assistant, etc.)\nApplications are to be submitted to the Departmental Graduate Assistant. The deadline for applications is January 25.\nAbout Brenda Carter and David Wheeler\nBrenda Carter (1937-1989)\nBrenda Carter was born in Battersea, a borough of London, England, on June 24, 1937. At the age of eleven, she won a scholarship to Grey Coat School, Westminster, and from there went to Salisbury Training College where she studied to become an elementary school teacher. She taught first at a school in the Scilly Islands, then moved to successively more responsible positions in schools in the County of Surrey. In 1972 she was appointed head teacher of Duppas Junior School in the Borough of Croydon, a low-achieving school situated in socially mixed area. By the time she resigned from this position for reasons of health in 1984, the standards of work by the children at the school in academic subjects, sports, arts and music, had risen to above average levels.\nIn 1984 Brenda Carter married and moved to Canada. Unable to teach for physical reasons, she enrolled in a master's program in the history of education at McGill University. At the time of her death on April 12, 1989, she had just embarked on writing up a study of one-room schoolhouses in the province of Québec at the beginning of this century.\nWithout formal mathematical qualifications, Brenda had a strong intuitive grasp of mathematical processes and procedures, and while not a doctrinaire feminist, she very much wanted many more women to find the keen pleasure in mathematics that she had found in it. The Memorial Scholarship was established by her husband, David Wheeler, a Professor of Mathematics at Concordia University from 1975 to 1990, and funded by the generous donations of friends and colleagues.\nDavid Wheeler (1925-2000)\nDavid Wheeler was born in UK on February 16, 1925. Through a career extending over 50 years and spent in three different countries (UK, USA, Canada), David Wheeler has made many important contributions to mathematical education at large. He was a professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in Concordia University, where he taught mathematics and mathematics education courses. He was the founder and long time editor of the journal, For the Learning of Mathematics, one of the renown international journals in mathematics education.\nDavid Wheeler died in Vancouver on October 7th, 2000. One of his colleagues, Mogens Niss, paid a tribute to him in these words: \"David Wheeler was a mathematics educator who never in a fraction of a moment forgot that, from his perspective, mathematics education ought to be provided to human beings, in order to serve their needs as human beings, and with due respect being paid to how human beings are different, and to how they live, feel and think. Hence empathy, open- and broadmindedness, an unpompous sense of reality, and not the least silent humour, should permeate the way we deal with mathematics education. All of these permeated David himself. We have indeed lost a giant in mathematics education, and some of us a dear friend as well.\"\nNick Herscovics Scholarship\nThe Nick Herscovics Scholarship is awarded to a student pursuing full-time studies in the M.T.M. program. The amount of the scholarship is $1,000 and it is awarded based on academic excellence. The award can be held by the same person for a maximum of two years. The selection of the recipient is made by the Director of the M.T.M program in consultation with other members of the Department.\nApplication forms for the award are available from, and are to be submitted to, the departmental Graduate Program Assistant. The deadline for receipt of applications is October 31.\nBack to top\n"}

He is survived by his wife Fauzia Begum, their son Syed Furrokh-Nabeel Ali (Samira Karim), and grandson Syed Aydin Karim Ali.\nTwareque completed his doctoral studies in mathematical physics at the University of Rochester in1973.  After periods of research and teaching in ICTP Trieste, University of Toronto, UPEI, and ITP Clausthal, Germany, he joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Concordia University in 1981.  He was promoted to full professor here in 1990.\nTwareque pursued research in many areas of mathematics, mostly in analysis, functional analysis, and quantum mechanics.  He published his work with numerous scientists around the world in over 120 research articles and in a number of books. He was always studying and preparing lectures, now wavelets, now differential geometry, now group theory. His presentations were structured, lucid, interesting, deep, and, before the fashion of electronic displays, by means of perfectly clear handwriting on the blackboard. \nHe was not inclined to profess an overt teaching philosophy but an observer might infer that it was ‘empowerment through mathematical understanding’.  He was himself impressively erudite with an eclectic taste that included history, philosophy and literature, and the mastery of at least five European languages in addition to Bengali and Hindi, and some Farsi and Arabic.\nHe was extremely generous and engendered enormous affection in his students and colleagues. He had an amusing story or anecdote for almost every occasion – often related to other mathematicians he knew from his extensive travels – and had a repertoire of funny jokes that naturally prompted his distinctive laughter.\nHis inspiring presence and cheerful demeanor will be sorely missed by us all.\nTestimonials can be sent  here  for publication.\nMarch 17, 2016\nWith deep sorrow, I learned about the passing of Dr. Ali.\nTwareque was a very well known scientist, with important contributions in the field of Mathematics and Physics, but even more important he was an exceptional human being.\nI first met him in Havana, Cuba in the nineties. Had the honour to organize, jointly with him, the first workshop in Wavelets and Quantization Methods at the University of Havana. Thanks to his remarkable persistence, the event went on for almost two decades and left a fingerprint in the scientific community, not only in Cuba but in a wider Latin American context.    His leadership allowed for a durable and fruitful relationship between both Math departments at Concordia and Havana universities , along all these years.\nHe fell in love with the city of Havana and its people, and was consequent with this feeling over his entire life. There, he left behind numerous friends and colleagues, well aware of his limitless generosity, sense of solidarity and contagious laugh.\nPablo Olivares\nAssociate Professor, Department of Mathematics\nRyerson University\nFebruary 18, 2016\nThere is nothing not to like about Professor Ali.\nI first met him in Malaysia, during his first visit as an invited speaker to our Expository Quantum Lecture Series in 2007 (EQuaLS1) with the theme of Geometry, Number Theory and Quantum Physics 2007. He for sure was among the expert in the field of quantization theory. The event was organized by INSPEM, University Putra Malaysia. During his visit, I approached him discussing whether I can further my Ph.D under his supervision. He agreed and through his help and justification mentioning Montreal is among the best place to study mathematical physics, I managed to get a government scholarship starting early September 2008.\nDays in Montreal have never been so difficult for us. Despite being an expert in his field, he was so humble in nature. He has been very helpful with almost everything since the early day we arrived. His friends are all over and through him, my other half has had this opportunity to make contacts with the engineering department of Concordia and until now remain in good relationship. Our almost five years in Montreal have been so fruitful. Thanks to him.\nAfter I finished in 2014, we remained to be in good contacts and he has supported our EQuaLS series continuously. Therefore, his recent visit to Malaysia (EQuaLS8) was the most unforgettable memory since it didn't occur to me that it was going to be his last visit. He has contributed much to our institute, INSPEM through his ideas, suggestions and a lot more. Most of us here in Malaysia will never forget Prof. Ali and he has become part of our big 'family' here in the institute. Professor Ali will definitely be missed.\nMy deepest condolences, to his wife and family.\nNurisya Mohd Shah\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Physics\nUniversity Putra Malaysia\nFebruary 8, 2016\nI was postdoctoral fellow at CRM on October 1999.  I think it must have been early November, and an elegant sir apparently of Indian origin (I did not know at the time he was from Bangladesh) knocked at the ajar door of my office and introduced himself to me in Italian, with the typical regional accent of Trieste.\nThat was a surreal moment!\nOver the past 16 years he has been a continuous presence in personal and professional life; his then PhD student Anna, became my wife and Twareque was present at my wedding in Poland (and he danced too!)\nHis office is just two doors down the corridor: his endearing laughter still echoes in my ear when I sit in my office. His wide interests and education made his company fantastically pleasant and never obtrusive.\nI have very fond memories of Twareque, in particular those associated to the conferences we attended together, several times, in Bialowieza and Havana.\nHis untimely passing leaves all of us disconcerted.\nMy wife Anna, my Parents Daria and Pino and myself are deeply saddened by his passing and wish to extend our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel and his family.  \nMarco Bertola\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 3, 2016\nI knew Twareque since he began his career at Concordia.  He was special and unique in so many ways.  Academically, he was very well established as an expert in mathematical physics and had professional contacts literally in every corner of the world.  I don’t know anyone else who traveled as extensively as he did to give invited talks, or to participate in conferences, or official exchange programs between Concordia and other universities that were created through his initiative, such as the annual one between Concordia and the University of Havana and another one with the University of Bialystok, Poland.\nTwareque was one of the most broadly educated people I have known.  Besides his own areas of expertise in mathematical physics, he was familiar with philosophy, history, literature and poetry. He spoke six or seven languages, and was quite at home in most of the countries he visited. \nHe was an excellent teacher who also taught in the Science College from time to time and the students there greatly appreciated the way he introduced them to genuine mathematical thinking.  He had a terrific sense of humour and an endless supply of stories and anecdotes.  I chatted with him over a cup of coffee just a few days before he left for Malaysia and feel a very profound sense of loss.  We will all miss his stories, his laughter, his wisdom and his expertise.\nHal Proppe\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 2, 2016\nTwareque is one of the most outstanding men I have known. A man of great culture and modesty.\nI am friends with Twareque since 1998. I had the chance to meet him thanks to one of the many academic responsibilities he had, both within and outside the university, such as member of the Graduate Committee of the Mathematics and Statistics Department at Concordia University, 1999-2002; member of a special committee appointed by the Dean to study the future of the Department of Physics and that recommended measures to restructure it, 2000-2001; he was a member of the Organizing Committee of the XI to the XXVI Colloquia on Geometric Methods in Physics, developed in Bialowieza, Poland, from 1992 to 2007; Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of Montreal, 2003-2006; member of the Organizing Committee and founder of I to XVIII Workshops held in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Havana; he helped the development of international scientific cooperation between the University of Havana, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Center for International Academic Cooperation at Concordia University. In particular, Twareque's contribution to the scientific development of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer at University of Havana was outstanding, since 1998 when he began collaborating with the Faculty, encouraging the participation of its members in research and in the development of the research on Wavelets and its various applications, including in Physics.\nAnother of Twareque's contributions was the organization of an annual workshop of international importance to promote the participation of - and exchange with - young faculty members, which gave much added vitality to the event. Twareque showed a great capacity to help the University of Havana and in particular, the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, by donations of computer equipment for the Faculty and through his efforts in bringing international experts to exchange experiences with the Cuban mathematical community and to deliver specialized courses. In 2009, in recognition for his service and efforts, the University of Havana awarded Twareque the special title of Invited Professor.\nHe was a man of extreme human sensitivity. Special friend of my family. We regret the loss of a great friend and a great man of science. I wish to express my condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel.\nReinaldo Rodriguez\n"}

Non-program students who need to take math courses, including independent students, can also see one of our academic advisors depending on the situation. \nThe information below will help to know what to do or whom to contact.\n \nPlease call the following (main telephone number: 514-848-2424) to get information:\nArts & Science: ext. 2104\nEngineering & Computer Science: ext. 3055\nFine Arts: ext. 4612\nOnce you submit an application, you will be given a netname and password to use to check your application status on the MyConcordia Portal .\n \nNew student orientation/advising sessions\nOrientation/advising sessions are organized each year for new students in our programs, and usually take place during the months of May until August. Students are invited to attend these sessions by email.\nIf you missed the orientation/advising session, you are encouraged to see  the academic advisor  of their program of study prior to registering for any course. You should bring your letter of admission.\nReturning students in a Mathematics & Statistics program are encouraged to see the academic advisor  of their program of study every year prior to registration. Students can also see an academic advisor throughout the year, as needed.\n \nMost frequent academic advising questions & answers\n \nWhat can I do if I can't register because the course is full?\nThe SIS system has a waiting list feature that has discontinued the practice of requesting course overfills through our Department. If the course you want to register for is full, the SIS system will automatically ask you if you want to be on a waiting list, and if you agree, it will tell you what number you are on the list.  You will then be informed by email when space becomes available and you will automatically be registered in the course.\nPlease note that the Department cannot add you to the waiting list, nor can it change your place on the list. Enrollment capacities for each section have been increased and normally reflect the number of seats in the classroom.  Overfilling a classroom size is not permitted as it is against University fire regulations.\nHow can I add or remove exemptions?\nExemptions are different from prerequisite waivers. An exemption is granted to a student upon admission if the student took and passed a course required in their program with more than D+ in CEGEP or equivalent studies. Changes in exemptions are exceptional and students need to have compelling reasons.\nAdding exemptions\nIf you realize that you were not given an exemption for a course that should have been included, you can request to add an exemption, as follows:\nMathematics & Statistics program students must submit a student request form with supporting documents to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in LB 901-2.  The request is then given to our Undergraduate Program Director for his recommendation and sent to the Faculty for their approval.  The student will receive a revised admissions letter should it be approved, or will be informed if not.\nStudents in other programs must contact their home department to find out the procedures even if it is to add an exemption for one of our courses.\nIndependent students must contact the independent student advisor to find out the procedures.\nPlease ensure that the student request form is filled properly, otherwise it will cause unecessary delays that may result in the request not being approved. The student request should include a valid reason, a current copy of your student record, and supporting documentation validating request.\nRemoving exemptions\nIf an exemption was granted to you but you did not receive a grade that is required in some programs, you may request to have an exemption removed so that you can take the course again and get a better grade. \nYou can request to remove an exemption as follows:\nMathematics & Statistics program students must submit a student request form with supporting documents to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in LB 901-2; a strong case must be made.  The request is then given to the Undergraduate Program Director for his recommendation and sent to the Faculty for their approval.  The student will receive a revised admissions letter should it be approved, or will be informed if not.\nStudents in other programs must contact their home department to find out the procedures even if it is to remove an exemption for one of our courses.\nIndependent students must contact the independent student advisor to find out the procedures.\nPlease ensure that the student request form is filled properly, otherwise it will cause unecessary delays that may result in the request not being approved. The student request should include a valid reason, a current copy of your student record, and supporting documentation validating request.\nWhat are the procedures for a late DNE or DISC?\nLate DNE or DISC requests are done through a Student Request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form (found on your MyConcordia Portal under Student Administrative Affairs) and must include a valid reason, a current copy of your student transcript, and any support documentation validating your request.  Submission of these requests are done as follows:\nMathematics and Statistics program students must submit a completed student request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in room LB 901-2.  The request will be reviewed by our Pre-University Math Coordinator for MATH 200-209 courses and our Undergraduate Program Director for courses above MATH 209, and will be sent to Student Academic Services of the Arts & Science Faculty.  If it is accepted at that level, the Faculty will remove the student from the course and notify them. The student will also be notified if the Faculty does not accept their request.\nStudents in other programs must contact their home department even if they want to register for one of our courses. \nIndependent students must see an independent student advisor.\nPlease ensure that the student request form is filled properly, otherwise it will cause unecessary delays that may result in the request not being approved. \nHow can I register or withdraw for a course after the registration deadline date?\nLate registration/withdrawal requests are done through a \"Student Request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form\" (found on your MyConcordia Portal under Student Administrative Affairs) and must include a valid reason, a current copy of your student transcript, written permission from the instructor of the course/section, and any support documentation validating your request.  Submission of these requests are done as follows:\nMathematics and Statistics program students must submit a completed student request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in room LB 901-2.  The request will be reviewed by our Pre-University Math Coordinator for MATH 200-209 courses and our Undergraduate Program Director for courses above MATH 209, and will be sent to Student Academic Services of the Arts & Science Faculty.  If it is accepted at that level, the Faculty will register the student and notify them. The student will also be notified if the Faculty does not accept their request.\nStudents in other programs must contact their home department even if they want to register for one of our courses. \nIndependent students must see an independent student advisor.\nPlease ensure that the student request form is filled properly, otherwise it will cause unecessary delays that may result in the request not being approved. \nDoes your department hold placement exams?\nThere are currently placement tests for MATH 203, 204, 205; they are normally scheduled during the first week of class in September and January. If you quality to write a placement exam for one of these courses (see Placement Examination Information Sheet ), please fill a Request to Write a Placement Examination and submit it to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in LB 901-2.\nWhat are the procedures to get a pre-requisite waiver?\nStudents may request a pre-requisite waiver if they already took an equivalent course in the past. Courses completed more than 10 years ago may not be considered.  \nPre-requisite waivers for Mathematics or Statistics courses are requested through academic advisors depending on the course you wish to get a preprequisite for (please see table below). \nWhen meeting with the academic advisor, you need to have the course descriptions and the university or college transcript showing the course which is a prerequisite to the course you wish to take. \nIndependent Students: you must meet with the Independent Student Advisor first, as you may be required to fill a Pre-requisite Waiver form for Independent and Visiting Students .\nCourse\n"}

This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.\n“This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,” said Roy. “I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.” \nThree of this year’s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success.\nDavid Tagliamonti\nBachelor of Science – Actuarial Mathematics\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nMake a reading/homework/study schedule in week one of your term and stick to it.\nPush yourself to ask \"why?\" This will deepen your understanding of course material.\nStay healthy. Regularly playing a sport or going to the gym will keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused in school.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nA problem often has many solutions. The science is in finding a solution; the art is in finding the best one.\nUniversity is a great time to learn from others — not just professors, but fellow students as well.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nKeep learning long after your formal education comes to an end.\nCristy Vista\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nListen earnestly to your professors when they give a lecture, and to your colleagues when they share their thoughts. Understanding others can widen our own perspective.\nDon't let confusion build up — it can hamper learning. Clarify concepts or processes you don't understand as soon as you hear about them.\nLearning should not be a lonely process. When you're having a hard time, ask for help. Concordia has many resources you can tap.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nInformation is never neutral. It must not be simply digested, but carefully examined and reflected on.\nThe world is built in a way that we are unequal and completely reliant on each other. The comforts we may have are at the expense of others, and this makes us our brother’s keeper.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nStudying to just get the grade can be tedious and off-putting. Relate your coursework to your passions, long-term goals and aspirations. This approach can give you encouragement during difficult times. \n \nBachelor of Arts – Linguistics\nThree keys to a good education:\nFirst off, it requires professors that not only teach what they love, but who teach you how to think critically and nurture high-quality ignorance. In other words, they teach you how to express your curiosity in meaningful and practical ways.\nA good education is one that helps you develop skills that will serve you throughout your entire life.\nFinally, it involves a network of people that constantly encourage and motivate you to thrive.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nThere are many resources in place to help us succeed at Concordia. We are fortunate to have advisors, committees and activities for everyone.\nI also learned to take classes from different departments. FAS has hundreds of different courses offered. This allows us to view the world from multiple perspectives.\nOne piece of advice to fellow students:\nBe resilient and passionate — the rest will follow!\n \n"}

It impacts our lives and the way we do things, and our researchers  are contributing to these developments” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.\n“The patents that Concordia’s innovators have been awarded are the result of years of work, and dedication to the idea of taking research results an extra step and improving a process or a product.”\nFrom inception to commercialization\nMaria Amer , an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was honoured for a noise reduction technology she and her students developed. It improves brightness and colour information in digital images without blurring their details.\nAmer’s new video processing technology is now commercially available through a license deal with wrnch Inc., a company backed up Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban. The video denoising technology was later licensed to Red Giant, an American filmmaking and motion graphics company.\nAmer says her research is driven by the need to innovate, and that commercialization is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n“You cannot fully plan where you go as a researcher,” she adds.\n“I started with a technology in 2009, but it turned out not to be powerful enough against industrial denoisers competition. I felt the challenge to outperform what was currently available on the market, so I asked one of my PhD students to work on this and he excelled.”\nAmer is now working on video object tracking methods. Her goal is to fundamentally advance new technology and scientific knowledge in this area, but if she finds an industry niche, she and her team may turn their attention to applied research.\n \nMaria Amer's video denoising technology has been licensed to Red Giant , an American filmmaking and motion graphics company. | Image courtesy of Pond5 via Red Giant\nInnovating to meet society’s challenges\nEverything from online auction interfaces to self-sealing building materials have been developed at Concordia.\nHere are descriptions of other recently patented inventions:\nBetter braking and steering\nWaizuddin Ahmed , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, specializes in system dynamics and design for road and railway vehicles.\nHe holds a patent on an independently controlled active steering system that not only enhances handling but also improves braking-in-a-turn performance of road vehicles. The independent control is further realized using a fail-safe mechanism and has potential for numerous other applications in active chassis control technology.\nNew dimensions in data\nArmen Atoyan , a senior lecturer of mathematics and statistics in the Faculty of Arts and Science, holds a patent for a new method of record-fast interpolation of data points within a multi-dimensional dataset.\nHis invention is of particular interest for application in the area of digital image processing, including both still and real-time images.\nPurpose-built nanoparticles\nJohn Capobianco , professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, is a specialist in the synthesis, characterization and spectroscopy of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.\nHis patented technology, in part, upconverts nanoparticles’ near-infrared light into the UV, visible and red regions. The results of this research, conducted in collaboration with students and other associates, have attracted considerable attention due their potential biomedical applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.\nSmart sensors for surgery\nJavad Dargahi , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is one of Canada’s leading experts in the application of haptic feedback systems\nIn his work with research associate Saeed Sokhanvar, he developed a patented smart tactile sensor and force and softness haptic feedback systems for robotic applications. His research could be implemented in hospitals offering minimally invasive, endoscopic surgeries.\nStronger, self-healing composites\nSuong Van Hoa , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has had marked success in obtaining patents for new inventions.\nOne area of his research focuses on the detection of defects in composite structures, such as airplanes, automobiles and wind turbines, to ensure that they are safe. His patents include an electrically conductive adhesive sheet for joining structural elements, a self-healing composite material designed to repair cracks and a system for making high-performance epoxies with clay particles.\nNew market mechanisms\nGregory Kersten , a professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, focuses on auctions and negotiations management\nHe developed an innovative market mechanism for procurement in computerized multi-attribute reverse auctions — a situation in which multiple sellers engage in a bidding process with a single buyer. Under Kersten’s mechanism, sellers are constrained to submit bids from admissible sets and the winner is selected by a pre-determined set of the buyer’s preferences that are unknown to the bidders.\nMiniature diagnostic tools\nMuthukumaran Packirisamy , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has been prolific in developing new technologies, having recently patented five new discoveries.\nPackirisamy is a specialist in biomedical microelectromechanical systems, or BioMEMS. Many of his inventions have to do with the miniaturization of photonic components for information technologies and diagnostic tools for health care to detect cancer and other illnesses that may be lurking in a person’s bloodstream. His latest work involves a power cell that harnesses electrical energy from the photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae.\nMore efficient heating systems\nGeorgios Vatistas , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, who has gained international renown for proving Nobel Prize-winner J.J. Thomson’s 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex rings, is an expert in research about how vortices can make energy exchange more economical.\nHis recently patented heat exchanger technology, which uses four to six times less energy to operate and is considerably smaller than a traditional shell-and-tube exchanger, and uses 40 times less energy to operate than the traditional plate heat exchanger, builds on his previous work in swirling water and air flows.\nFind out more about  resources for Concordia researchers .\nPresentations at Concordia's Technology and Innovation Recognition event were also made by some of the university's partners in innovation support, including Aligo Innovation, TandemLaunch and Fasken Martineau.\n \n"}

They stood beside posters bearing details about their work terms and what they had gained from their various on-the-job experiences.\nMegan Brown, who graduated from Concordia’s computer science program last fall, spent her final work term at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, where she developed an application for a remote-controlled car that can be operated using any Windows 10 device.\nBrown has accepted a job with the software behemoth, and she’s relocating to Washington in a few weeks.\nComputer engineering student Vincent Bilodeau spent his last work term at the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, optimizing audio effects and performing hardware performance profiling. “It’s pretty cool, you get to work on something, then play guitar, work on it a little more, then play some more guitar,” he said, smiling.\nBilodeau has a few courses left before he graduates, but he signed a contract for freelance work with Fender this summer, and he’s hopeful about his prospects for a future with the company.\nAccountancy student Nicholas Chin recently completed a work term at the professional services company KPMG where he helped corporate executives with their personal tax returns. He’s found his passion, he said. But before looking for his first job after he graduates this spring, he’s going to take some time off to travel. The ticket to Italy’s already booked. \n \nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi (far left) and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau (second from left) shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award.\nCo-op’s $8 million contribution\nHughes provided some figures to illustrate the program’s growth and diversity: Currently there are more than 40 Co-op programs at Concordia, including three new ones this year, in mathematical and computational finance , biology and aerospace engineering .\nClose to 1,800 students are enrolled as Co-op members, and they secured 1,400 work placements over the past year. On an annual basis, students in the program earn in the neighbourhood of $8 million. “This helps them with their education, but it also helps the local economy,” Hughes said.\nA vital bridge\nCatherine Bolton , Concordia’s vice-provost for teaching and learning, compared Co-op to a bridge, connecting the classroom to the workplace. “It results in an increase of possibilities — to communicate, to meet, to work together and to learn from each other,” she said. “This bridge partnership is vital to us, not only at the Co-op institute but also at Concordia.”\nBolton underlined the role Co-op’s experiential learning opportunities play in Concordia’s new strategic directions.\n“ Embrace the city, embrace the world speaks to the idea that Concordians can use their talents, expertise and energy to affect social change and to give back to the community that we live in, whether it's locally or globally,” Bolton said. “It is very clear that Co-op students and Co-op employers have long been helping us to achieve this goal.”\nCo-op’s ‘win-win’\nCo-op employer Angela D’Angelo, vice-president of training and client experience at National Bank Financial, highlighted the benefits of hiring Co-op students. “It’s win-win. It’s a two-way street,” she said. “You have no idea what these millennials can bring to your business, to your life and to your development.”\nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award .\nDe Masi said being a part of Co-op allowed her to face her fears and anxieties head on and develop the confidence needed to decide her career direction. “I've learned that it's important not to let people place you in a labelled box and tell you that that’s what you have to be in life,” she said. “I'll kick the box open and politely say, ‘No, thank you.’”\nBoudreau praised Co-op for allowing students to gain invaluable experience while working for employers who take a vested interest in developing their interns. “I really experienced this working on flight simulators and antennas for satellites. It was really remarkable to work with so many employers who would just listen, and be there when you needed help,” he said.\n“I learned to think a little less like a student and a little more like an engineer, and it reflected in the way that I came back to school.”\n"}
