Students should see it in that light.\nScience education is traditionally compartmentalized into departments, but science itself crosses those borders.\nThe Science College must have an encouraging and noncompetitive atmosphere and style.\nThe elements of the Science College were chosen with these principles in mind.\nStudents are involved in actual research for their entire stay at the College.\nStudents do at least 6 credits in the history and philosophy of science.\nStudents take interdisciplinary courses designed specifically for them.\nA document embodying all the above mentioned facts was presented to the Arts and Science faculty council and then to the Concordia University Senate. It was approved on April 27, 1979. To publicize the new college, the Science College  public lectures  were created, and they are still one of the major public events of the Science College.\nAs the years have passed there has been a greater demand for this type of programme and the College has grown. In 1979, there were 12 students compared to over 80 currently. But this number is still quite small and with good reason. Small numbers make for an intense learning experience where students get to know and work with each other, question the status quo, get an overview of science as a whole and participate in cutting edge research in three different areas during their tenure. The result is that Science College alumni can be found in top positions in science and medicine, both in Canada and abroad.\nContact us\nScience College:\n514-848-2424 ext. 2595\n"}

Founded in 1979, the Science College espouses the following well-defined, distinct, and important concepts of science education: student participation in laboratory research activities from the first year on and a curriculum emphasizing cross-disciplinary thinking as well as intensive student-faculty and student-student interaction. The Science College accepts as members applicants who show high motivation and potential for excellence. It's academic program complements the regular undergraduate program.\nThe following principles underlie the philosophy of the education offered by the College:\nScience is a system of thought and not a collection of facts.\nScience does not exist in a void, but forms part of the human tradition.\nScience education is traditionally compartmentalized into departments, but science itself crosses those borders.\nEducation is not a zero-sum game. Thus, the Science College promotes and encourages a non-competitive atmosphere that complements its success.\nThe elements of the Science College were chosen with these principles in mind:\nStudents are involved in  actual research  for their entire stay at the College.\nStudents must take a 6-credit course on the \"historical, sociological and philosophical aspects of science.\"\nStudents take  interdisciplinary courses  designed specifically for them.\nThe Science College is intended to allow a student to become independent, self-motivated, and articulate. Students should emerge with a profound understanding of a chosen discipline and reasonable literacy in other branches of science.\nContact us\nScience College:\n514-848-2424 ext. 2595\n"}

It also provides an opportunity for students to get together over lunch. The atmosphere is science — whether it be wrestling with a problem together, talking with a teacher, or proposing a new idea for discussion. This type of social interaction is an all-important factor in the life of scientists — who spend a lot of their career interacting with others in the field — and is the best way to gain a real understanding of scientific problems. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, to help each other, and to learn from each other. All are seen as essential ingredients of an education.\nOur  research  component is unique in Canada. Students are not just doing laboratory exercises. They are active and interested participants in the resolution of current scientific problems. This role both sharpens their understanding of science and gives them first-hand experience with what to expect from a scientific career. It has been our experience that the most interested and motivated students would rather do the research than view it from a distance.\nOur unique  courses  complement the student's standard science curriculum by offering a wide variety of cross-disciplinary courses designed especially for Science College students.\n \n"}
