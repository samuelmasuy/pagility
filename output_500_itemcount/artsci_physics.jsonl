We electromigate the junction to connect single molecules and study their electronic spectrum.\nWe make use of a low temperature gated-mechanical breakjunction system (see Figure), which can controllably stress a nanosystem to tune its shape and strain, while simultaneously making detailed transport measurements. We want to understand how the interplays between structure (lattice, defects, shape, strain, boundaries, phonons) and electronic interactions (Coulomb interactions, screening, charged excitations) determine the properties of nanosystems (scattering, band structure, ground states, coherence, excited states).\nA suspended carbon nanotube inside a gated-Mechanical Breakjunction (g-MCBJ)\nHeat transport measures the energy carried by both electrons and phonons and is fundamental to understanding a material, its ground states, excitations and scattering mechanisms.\nImage of a 1 micron long suspended graphene(one-atom thick) crystal.\nMeasurements of thermal conductivity and thermopower over a broad temperature range (1.5-300 Kelvin) will assess graphene's promising potential for thermal management in nanoscale electronics.

Using a low-temperature mechanical breakjunction system, we will study their potential as tunable ultra-high frequency nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), and we expect these very short ribbons to have resonant frequencies in the THz range.\nThese NEMS will make very sensitive nanoscale sensors, since even a very small force or mass on the oscillator will cause a shift of its resonant frequency. We also want to use these sensors as laboratories to explore the physics of carbon nanotube and graphene quantum dots.\nCartoon of electron transport in a quantum dot nano-oscillators\nTopological Insulators\n3D Topological insulators are a family of materials with a band gap but which have an odd number of 2D conducting surface states that cross the band gap at the boundaries of the crystal (See Figure). The word topological refers to the fact that they differ from regular insulators not because of a spontaneously broken symmetry but because of a topological order parameter which is invariant and can only be change if the system undergoes a quantum phase transition.\nWe make electron transport measurements in micron scale 3D topological insulators (TI) to explore the physics of their surface states and the exotic correlated states that they can form when a band gap (mass term) in introduced in their dispersion. These studies are important to develop a fundamental understanding of this new class of correlated electron states, and to develop the potential of these materials as putative room temperature spintronics materials.\nBi2Se3 micron-sized crystal with 6 photolithographically defined electrodes.

Phys.\nDefect-engineering in silicon nanowires (Si-NWs)\nIn collaboration with the group of Prof. Oussama Moutanabbir (Ecole Polytechnique), we investigate how engineered defects (stacking faults) in silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) affect charge carrier and phonon transport. We study individual Si-NWs grown by the VLS method (Moutanabbir), see Figure, with ordered lattice defect planes along the growth direction. Characterization of the Si-NWs is done by micro-Raman spectroscopy which is sensitive to the presence of crystal faults. Transport and magneto-transport measurements are done at low temperature in single suspended Si-NWs transistors. We are interested in exploring fundamental quantum transport in Si-NW quantum dots, as well as their application in thermal energy harvesting. The thermal conductivity, K, of Si-NWs is lower than for bulk silicon. Defect and surface engineering of Si-NWs can further reduce K, improving the thermoelectric efficiency (ability to harvest energy) to maximizing the figure of merit ZT = (S^2)*sigma*T/K. This would have applications in industry such as improving thermocouples to gather more thermal energy from vapor exhausts.\nLeft panel, high-resolution TEM image of a Si-NW crystal’s structure showing stacking faults along the growth direction.

Satisfying these needs by burning fossil fuels results in pollution, undesired climate changes and eventual exhaustion of the fuel reserves. Nuclear energy is not problem-free either. Renewable energy is likely to provide the solution for these challenges. Sun offers the most abundant potential source of energy and delivers 3,850,000x1018 J per year to Earth, compared to ~630 x1018 J per year currently consumed by the human civilization. Sun energy was supporting the life on Earth for billions of years via process of photosynthesis. (In fact, all existing fossil fuel reserves originate from photosynthesis processes of long ago.) As a result of evolution, proteins performing the first steps of photosynthesis achieved amazing effectiveness. Can we learn something useful from Nature by exploring how these first steps are organized? To this end, we explore energy and primary charge separation processes in isolated photosynthetic proteins.\n \n \nFigure 1. Left: Top view of plant Photosystem I. Blue: protein. Grey: chlorophylls. Yellow: carotenoids. Red: quinones, Orange: FeS clusters.\nRight: side view of the bacterial reaction center. Grey: bacteriochlorophylls. Dark-blue: bacteriopheophytines, Red: quinones, Orange: non-heme iron. Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for determining BRC structure in 1988 .\nProteins involved in photosynthesis can also serve as model systems in the studies of some very general protein features. Proteins perform wide variety of tasks in the living organisms. Their ability to perform the designated tasks depends critically on their tertiary structure, achieved as a result of folding. But how do proteins “know” how to fold properly? It is well known that they fold to minimize their free energy (including electrostatic and entropic terms). However, folding even a small protein by trial and error would take forever (Levinthal paradox). Thus, proteins are believed to possess funnel-like energy landscapes with multiple hierarchal tiers. These landscapes can be explored using optical spectroscopy. Proteins involved in photosynthesis have in-built fluorescent molecules (chlorophylls) that can serve as very sensitive probes to local protein environment. Optical spectroscopy also allows one to explore heat transport in proteins and through protein-water interfaces.\nPhotosynthetic reaction centers utilize light energy to transfer electrons through the (thylakoid or cell) membrane. A number of substances can inhibit this process. (The strongest of these substances are agricultural herbicides.) We have demonstrated inhibition of electron transfer in isolated photosynthetic reaction centers by explosives and are continuing to work on photosynthesis-based explosives biosensors.\nFigure 2. Relationship between single photosynthetic complex spectroscopy and spectral hole burning. The raster-scan image of the sample containing multiple complexes (of the same type, e.g. LH2) is in the center. One can select a single complex (left, one complex contains multiple chlorophyll molecules, hence multiple spectral lines, © Köhler’s Group, Bayreuth), or one can work with the whole ensemble (right) and select molecules in resonance with the narrow-band laser. Then a small conformational change of the environment may be triggered by light, shifting the absorption of these molecules.\nWe are capable of spectroscopic measurements on both single molecules and macroscopic samples. Mostly we employ so-called site-selective sub-ensemble spectroscopy techniques (non-photochemical spectral hole burning - in protein or amorphous solids context this involves small conformational changes triggered by light; fluorescence line narrowing, etc). We are also developing various software tools to model single-molecule and site-selective spectroscopy results. Currently we are working on bridging the size-scale gap and engaging in the studies of sub-micron biological samples utilizing Convex-Lens Induced Confinement technique (credit for inspiration to Sabrina Leslie of McGill). The distinguishing feature of our approach is taking CLIC to cryogenic temperatures. On the other hand, at room temperature CLIC cell can be used as tunable-size micro- or nano-fluidic cell for biosensor applications.\n Couple of years ago we started expanding our research to graphene and carbon nanotubes (in collaboration with Alexandre Champagne’s group). These systems exhibit a number of interesting optical/spectroscopic properties, particularly in quantum dot regime. Of special interest are simultaneous optical and electron transport measurements.\nResearch interests\nRenewable     energy: Optical spectroscopy of pigment-protein light-harvesting     photosynthetic complexes - energy transfer and charge transfer.\nBiophotonics / Protein     structure and [low-temperature] dynamics - Protein-chlorophyll complexes     as model systems.

He has also been involved in electron spin-lattice relaxation studies, with the latest research being on exploitation of amplitude-modulation technique in measuring very short spin-lattice (T1) and electron-electron (T2) relaxation times, in the range of one-tenth nano-second to one micro-second. Nine Ph. D. and ten Master?s students have received their degrees under his supervision\nHe has served as an external examiner to several Ph. D. theses examinations outside of Concordia University, submitted in Canada, France, and Australia. He serves as a referee to important journals in Physics and Chemistry which publish EPR research, e.g. the Physical Review and Physical Review Letters, Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, Journal of Chemical Physics, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Magnetism and magnetic Materials, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Journal of Applied Magnetic Resonance. He has published several review articles in EPR, as well as he has written book chapters in leading research monographs.

Thanks to the properties of photons (the virtual particles that carry light), photonics has the potential for creating faster and more power-efficient devices than electronics. One of the building blocks for photonic circuits is the optical micro-resonator, which keeps light confined in both space and time. Micro-resonators are the basis of many photonic devices, such as filters, modulators, delay lines, etc. We are interested in exploring optical micro-resonators with new geometries and materials for creating new micro- and nanophotonic devices.\nA hollow microtube is an optical microresonator.

We can use this to make very sensitive optical sensors, which let us measure minute changes in refraction index, concentration, or even the presence of nanoparticles, viruses, or bacteria.\nSchematic representation of how a microresonator sensor works.\n"}

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst.\nThorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes.\nWe are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions.\nThe biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution.\nWhy study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.\nRepresentative publications\nM. Dong,  A. Babalhavaeji,  M.

Christophe Grova is directing The Multimodal Functional Imaging Laboratory , a multidisciplinary team composed of neurologists and methodologists, investigating  multimodal data fusion to characterize brain mechanisms in healthy conditions and also during epileptic activity.\nBeing affiliated to both Biomedical Engineering and Neurology and Neurosurgery Departments at McGill University since July 2008, Dr. Grova investigates the integration of multimodal functional data to study brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic activity. His research project aims at combining multimodal data in order to detect additional information that could be missed by considering each modality individually. His project involves the integration of three promising functional modalities:\nSimultaneous ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) - MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) acquisitions, measuring directly on the scalp electric and magnetic components of epileptic signals generated by neurons synchronously active (at a ms scale). Source localization procedure is then required to localize the generators of these discharges within the brain.\nSimultaneous EEG - functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI acquisitions to measure, within the whole brain at a second scale, hemodynamic responses that correlate with epileptic discharges detected on scalp EEG.\nSimultaneous EEG - Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) acquisitions to measure local changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the time of epileptic discharges detected on scalp EEG, by exploiting absorption properties of infrared light within brain tissues using optic fibres placed on the surface of the head.\nThe comparison of EEG/fMRI and EEG/NIRS offers a unique way to address in vivo the question of the integrity of the neurovascular coupling in the epileptic brain. In addition of studying brain mechanisms at the time of epileptic discharges, Dr. Grova is currently applying similar methodologies to study resting state functional connectivity in epilepsy patients.\nIn July 2014, Christophe Grova became  an assistant Professor in the Physics Department and a researcher in the brand new multimodal imaging platform of the  PERFORM centre at Concordia University, while remaining an adjunct Professor in Biomedical Engineering Department and Neurology and Neurosurgery Department of McGill University . This new imaging platform of PERFORM is equipped with a 3T MRI, simultaneous SPECT/CT and PET/CT devices, TMS and high density MR compatible EEG.

Kalman Research Group\nIn traditional lecture courses as well as courses that use interactive engagement, students are less expert-like at the end of the course than they were at the beginning (Madsen, McKagan, & Sayre, 2015). Our recent research was based on the hypothesis that students' epistemological beliefs could become more expert-like with a combination of appropriate instructional activities: (a) pre-class reading with metacognitive reflection (Kalman, 2011), and (b) in-class active learning that produces cognitive dissonance (Kalman et al. 2015).\n \nGroup members\nOur research group has been designing many new pedagogical approaches for a long time (e.g., Kalman et al., 1999; Kalman, Rohar, & Wells, 2004; Kalman et al., 2008; Kalman, Sobhanzadeh, Thompson, Ibrahim, & Wang, 2015) to help students succeed in their courses (e.g., Kalman & Rohar, 2010; Kalman, Milner-Bolotin, & Antimirova, 2010; Khanam & Kalman, 2016). Our focus has now gone beyond the question of whether or not a pedagogical technique is effective, toward a more intense focus on finding a class of techniques that is effective in helping students become more like expert thinkers.

Many had not seen each other for decades, and happily travelled long space-time distances to reconnect.\nAlumni at the reunion were full of genuine excitement to see former teachers and classmates; there was laughter erupting from old stories and questions about the current reality in the department.\n \nJeff Lawy BSc 01, MBA 08, shared inspirational ideas with younger alumni on how volunteering can also be a strategic career move. Daniel Grozdanov, BSc 10, and Waël Chanab, BSc 10, wowed the crowd with their latest virtual reality work and Roch Comeau, BSc 89, shared a very personal account of how he went from a physics passion and “average” grades to building a sizeable company producing cutting-edge tools for medical research.\n \nCurrent department faculty Alex Champagne, Claudine Gauthier and Pablo Bianucci spoke about physics programs and research. They emphasized that the Concordia spirit of caring for students and one-on-one mentoring is being renewed in the department. Valter Zazubovits led a laboratory tour, where alumni saw both cutting-edge equipment as well as a few good-old set-ups they had used in their own studies.\n \nFor all of us faculty and staff who had a chance to see former students, the event was a real treat. We all rediscovered how rich and diversified our alumni are. We already look forward to seeing you again and promise to keep in touch.\n \nWe sincerely thank you and feel privileged to be part of your community,\n \nYour physics faculty and colleagues from Concordia.\nFind an expert\nSearch for an expert to comment on any topic\nEnter a phrase or keyword\nBack to top\n"}

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst.\nThorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes.\nWe are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions.\nThe biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution.\nWhy study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.\nRecent publications\nS.

The nano-crystal size distributions have been characterised using dark field mode X-TEM and are well described by a lognormal probability density function which provides characteristic values for the mean size,L and the standard deviation,σ . Under nonresonant (473 nm) pumping, the photoluminescence (PL) transients associated with the Er3+ first excited (4/13/2) to ground state (4/15/2) transition (1534 nm) reveal a multiexponential character indicative of the local environment of the emitting centres. A detailed analysis of the decay transients reveals two distinct classes of luminescent erbium; one of these populations, at a distance on the order of a bond length (~0.3 nm) from the nano-crystal interface, exhibits a relatively short radiative lifetime (between 3 and 5 ms) dependent on the size of the neighbouring nano-crystal. Calculations reveal that this may be attributed to a Purcell-like enhancement of the radiative rate induced by local changes in the refractive index for the Er close to a spherical dielectric interface. The second population, which exhibits a much longer lifetime (between 10 and 15 ms), is characteristic of that of Er in a stoichiometric SiO2 host. The presence of a fast component (between 500 and 800 μs) in all of the transients is attributed to non-radiative ion-ion interactions as a result of the formation of Er/Er-O clusters. These results may have implications for the design of future waveguide optical amplifiers.\nDr. Iain F. Crowe \nNovember 27, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nMeasuring heat at the nanoscale\nA quantity seldomly measured during nanoscale processes is the heat released or required by a process, and yet it gives key information about these processes because it measures directly how the energy of the system evolves. Much like differential scanning calorimetry, nanocalorimetry is a technique where very thin layers are deposited on a membrane and are scanned in temperature, here at up to 1 million degrees per second, transforming small amounts of heat into measurable power. The technique can be applied in situ, avoiding exposition to ambient or starting at low temperature. In this presentation, we will review some of the application of the technique, from measuring melting point and Curie temperature depression in nanostructures to the relaxation in amorphous silicon, to solid-state reactions in ultra-thin films.\nDr. François Schiettekatte \nNovember 20, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nCoherent spintronics with electron and nuclear spins in nanostructures\nI will review some of the recent efforts (both experimental and theoretical) to gain full control over the coherent dynamics of spins in semiconductor nanostructures (quantum dots, wires, and wells). A serious challenge to these studies is to derive a microscopic Hamiltonian that accurately describes these many-spin systems and to predict the relevant dynamics. I will also review some potential applications of these studies, including the implementation of ideas from quantum information science.\nDr. Bill Coish, \nNovember 13, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nWhispering gallery mode resonators: from light propagation to biosensing\nLabel-free microsphere resonators were shown to be sensitive optical biosensors thanks to the very high quality factor up to Q~10^9 of their whispering gallery modes (WGMs). The spectral shift of a single mode of a single microsphere is the most common detection signal, but several resonances are available to probe the analyte frequency response in polarizability. However, the full spectrum of WGMs for an elliptical resonator is complicated, warranting further measures and optimizations of light propagation in this system. On one hand, our high resolution interferometric studies of the microsphere with a dual frequency comb provide both its impulse response in the time domain with 400 fs resolution and its transmission spectrum in the frequency domain with picometer resolution. In the former case, light pulses are periodically outcoupling from a ~73 mm microsphere after each round trip of ~1.13 ps with a phase delay depending on the refractive index of the surrounding medium. On the other hand, simpler WGM spectra are obtained with smaller ~10 mm fluorescent microspheres having a lower Q~2000, which are commercially available. These microspheres are then used in a more practical flow-cytometer based biosensing system making a compromise between sensitivity, sturdiness and ease of use.\nDr. Claudine Allen, \nNovember 6, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nQuantum transport in 10 nanometer-scale suspended graphene devices\nWe study coherent electron transport in suspended ultra-short graphene devices ranging from 10 to 100 nm in length. We developed a feedback-controlled electromigration method to fabricate these ultra-short suspended graphene devices. This customized method makes it possible to fabricate damage-free devices or introduce defects in a controlled way. Depending on their width, our devices show quantum dot (QD) behavior or ballistic (scattering-free) transport. We measure ballistic conductivity and Fabry-Prot interferences as a function of charge density in our devices. The data is in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the ballistic transport of Dirac (relativistic) fermions. The coherence length extracted from the Fabry-Prot oscillations is much longer than the length of our devices. We argue that this indicates ballistic transport in the source and drain electrodes (made of graphene capped with a gold film) connecting our suspended graphene transistors. This work sets up the stage to study the strain-engineering of electron transport in graphene, and provides essential information for the development of graphene nanoelectronics.\nVahid Tayari, \nOctober 30, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nSeeing Atoms in 3D\nHarnessing nanoscale and quantum phenomena in semiconductors creates valuable opportunities to achieve novel or superior functionalities with actual or potential impacts on nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, carbon-free energy conversion, and bio-integrated technologies. A precise probe of the structure and composition of semiconductor nanostructures is of paramount importance to understand the basic properties on the nanoscale of these highly attractive systems. Developing this body of knowledge is a crucial step to implement the emerging nanotechnologies and control their performance. In this presentation, we will describe the use of laser-assisted atom probe tomography to achieve tri-dimensional atom-by-atom mapping of single semiconductor nanostructures. The successful application of this technique enables a precise and rigorous analysis of the composition of a nanostructure and provides unprecedented insights into its internal structure. Examples including metal-catalyzed nanowires, nanomembranes, and superlattices will be presented and discussed.\nDr. Oussama Moutanabbir, \nOctober 23, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectron shot noise is quantum light\nElectrons in conductors have a disordered motion, a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"noise\". In classical physics, this noise (more precisely, the variance of current fluctuations) is proportional to the temperature and the conductance of the conductor. When we consider a tiny device placed at very low temperature, things change: one can no longer consider the electrons as classical particles, but quantum mechanics dictates their behavior. We will describe some concepts and experiments related to quantum noise in conductors. In particular we will show very recent experiments in which we observe that the noise emitted by such a conductor may consist of correlated photons and that it can be squeezed just like light in quantum optics.\nDr. Bertrand Reulet, \nOctober 16, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nGuiding axons and cells with laser engineering\nThe wiring of the nervous system during development is an autonomous process that creates a circuit several orders of magnitude more complex than the most sophisticated microchip ever produced. The formation of this overwhelmingly complex structure is ultimately governed by stochastic molecular interactions that repeatedly yield the same electrical design. Thus, understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance remains a challenging biological problem with remarkable clinical implications. We will describe new microfabrication strategies to reproduce protein gradients for studying axonal guidance in vitro. Lasers can be used to engineer artificial environments where the different chemical components mediating neuronal pathfinding can be precisely controlled to fabricate highly elaborate patterns. We will see how we can exploit this new method for elucidating the precise manner in which cells interpret the spatial distribution of chemical indicators.\nDr. Santiago Costantino \nMaisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Centre, Université de Montréal\nOctober 9, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectricity & Magnetism: Advances in Space Physics From Particles Motion to Nonlinear Waves\nSince the 1950s when space exploration began, Electricity & Magnetism has developed to a new stage. Electric (E) and magnetic (M) fields have been measured in different spatial scales of our electric universe. Based on observations, we demonstrate the characteristics of the motion of the charged particles driven by E&M fields, and the resultant non-Maxwellian distributions in velocity space. These particles produce nonlinear waves which are either simple-wave solitons or amplitude-modulated oscillatory solitons (called oscillitons). By making use of the fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism, a new space technology, electric tether propulsion for interplanetary exploration, attracts worldwide research and development.\nDr. Zhen Guo (John) Ma \nConcordia University\nOctober 2, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nQuantum Matter \"On-a-chip\"!\nQuantum physical phenomena are inherently different in dimensions lower than 3D. For instance, one can observe bizarre electronic quantum states in 2D with the properties of charge fractionalization, and in even lower dimension (1D) one can observe the conductance of a wire to be given by a single quantum corresponding to G=2e^2/h.\nIn this talk, I will describe a few low temperature experiment, all performed on some sort of a \"chip\", with the hope to elucidate bizarre quantum phenomena. These include our effort to detect bizarre particles that are neither boson or fermion, in 2D the 1D-1D Coulomb drag of electrons in two closed-pack quantum wires, separated by only ~15 nm, a nano-engineered quantum faucet (for real fluids!). It's a lot of (quantum) fun!\nDr. Guillaume Gervais \nSeptember 25, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nSome new applications of gauge/gravity duality\nIn this talk I'll briefly summarize the status of gauge/gravity duality and discuss some new applications of this duality to solve large N QCD and other related problems.\nDr. Keshav Dasgupta \nSeptember 18, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nAtomic-size semiconductor nanostructures\nShrinking semiconductor nanostructures to the size of a small molecule or a single atom would offer many interesting advantages: they would provide the uniformity and predictability of atomic defects, they would exhibit the high symmetry necessary for a number of promising applications, and they could confine charge carriers to a volume of atomic dimension, thereby reaching the ultimate limit of device integration.\nIn this presentation, I will describe our work on isoelectronic traps and how these nanostructures can bind excitons. Then, I will present our latest results on nitrogen, tellurium and beryllium molecules embedded in semiconductors. We find that these molecules can bind various charged configurations: negatively and positively charged excitons and biexcitons. Finally, using the bound exciton to define a two-level system, I will show that we can achieve complete coherent control over this qubit using a series of optical pulses.\nDr. Sébastien Francoeur \nDepartment of Engineering Physics, École Polytechnique de Montréal\nSeptember 11, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nOptical micro resonators: highly sensitive sensors and versatile filters\nOptical Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (OMEMS) attracted a lot of interest over the last decade. Several novel devices and products emerged from this technology in particular in telecommunication (e.g. optical fiber switches, projection displays, etc.). Today, the applications of these microsystems spread over a wide area ranging from astronomy to biology. Beyond the conventional engineered devices and products, optical MEMS are actually nothing else than a toolbox, which enables novel investigations of scientific phenomena at the nanoscale. In this context, my research activity focuses on tuning the optical properties of nanostructures using Micro Electro Mechanical Systems for applications in astronomy, telecommunications, aerospace, biology and medicine.\nDuring the seminar I will give an overview of our projects exploiting this new avenue (sensors and tunable devices based on photonic crystals and different types of optical resonators). Tunable in-plane Fabry-P rot cavities integrated on chip will be specifically highlighted through several different applications.\nDr. Yves-Alain Peter \nDepartment of Engineering Physics, École Polytechnique de Montréal\nSeptember 9, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room CC 305\nInvestigation of metastability effects in hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon thin films by the steady-state measurement methods\nUpon exposure of microcrystalline silicon (c-Si:H) thin films to room ambient, water vapour, di-onized water, or to different gas atmospheres, these materials frequently show metastability changes of their electronic properties. These changes are generally detected by using the techniques probing the properties of sample at the steady-state condition. Even though the first published results appeared at the beginning of 1980s by Veprek et al., more extensive investigation has been carried out in the last decade by using the steady-state measurements. In most studies, very thin samples deposited on smooth glass substrate were used in measurements due to adhesion problems of thicker samples on the smooth glass substrates. It was reported that conductivities in some materials increased and in others they decreased in the metastable state significantly, showing no clear functional dependence on the crystallinity of the material. These changes were reported to be reversible after heat treatment in short period after deposition and irreversible for longer periods of a few years. Such changes were mainly attributed to the band bending at the surface of the film, within cracks or at the grain boundaries.\nIn this study, we have developed new standard measurement procedures and applied to investigate the metastability phenomena using temperature dependent dark conductivity, steady-state photoconductivity (SSPC), sub-bandgap absorption spectroscopy as detected by dual beam photoconductivity (DBP) and steady-state photocarrier grating (SSPG) methods for c-Si:H thin films with a wide range of structure compositions. c-Si:H films were deposited using VHF-PECVD at 200C on both smooth and rough glass substrates. The microstructure of the films was changed from amorphous (a-Si:H) to highly crystalline by adjusting the process gas silane concentration during deposition. The crystallinity was evaluated from Raman measurements. Thickness of the samples varies between 200 nm and 1100 nm. Silver coplanar electrodes were evaporated on the samples with 0.5 cm length and 0.5 mm separation. The samples were randomly exposed to atmospheric gases by keeping them in the dark laboratory atmosphere. In addition, a controlled gas treatment was performed in high vacuum cryostat. Annealing was carried out at 430K in high vacuum. All probe measurements were performed at 300K as sample is at the steady-state condition. Metastable changes in dark conductivity due to Fermi level shifts and in majority carrier electron mobility-lifetime products, μn τn, determined from the SSPC measurements were correlated with those in the minority carrier hole mobility-lifetime products, μp τp , obtained from the SSPG measurements. In addition, sub-bandgap absorption coefficient spectra of the samples at the same treated states were carefully measured in order to see the changes in the density of occupied defect states in the bandgap of the microcrystalline silicon which affects both electron and hole transport properties. The results obtained in this study were discussed with those published in the literature on the metastability phenomena of microcrystalline silicon films.\nDr. Mehmet Günes \nMugla Sitki Kocman University, Turkey\nSeptember 4, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nEffects of distribution of excitation energy transfer times and protein dynamics on spectral hole burning in pigment-protein complexes involved in photosynthesis\nUnderstanding the spectral properties of natural photosynthetic complexes is important to advance the design of the artificial photosynthetic systems. Traditionally the spectral properties of natural photosynthetic complexes are explored by either time-domain or frequency-domain high-resolution spectroscopy methods, including non-photochemical spectral hole burning (NPHB).\nThe main goal of this research was the study of various effects of the distribution of excitation energy transfer times and protein dynamics on non-photochemical hole burning processes in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes. In the first part of this seminar we present our results concerning the inclusion of the distributions of excitation energy transfer (EET) rates (homogeneous line widths) and charge separation rates into treatment of the resonant and non-resonant NPHB processes in photosynthetic chlorophyll-protein complexes. The effects of the line width distributions resulting from Frster-type EET on the resonant NPHB process have been explored both theoretically and experimentally in isolated CP43 antenna from spinach. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that inclusion of the effects of frequency-dependent EET rate distributions and burning following EET on the treatment of non-resonant NPHB spectra of trimeric Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein from Cb. Tepidum leads to reasonable agreement between the theoretical and experimental data. Charge separation rate distributions were explored in PSII RC.\nThe second part of this presentation is focused on the analysis of HB spectral properties of the lowest energy states of Photosystem I (PSI) with the aims to gain better understanding of particular structural origins of these states as well as on the protein dynamics of PSI.\nNicoleta Herascu \nAugust 28, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nUltra-Short Carbon Nanotube Quantum Dot Transistors: Electron-Hole Asymmetry, Bending Vibrons, and the Kondo Effect\nUsing an electromigration procedure which we recently developed, we generate 10 nm-scale single-wall carbon nanotube quantum dot (SWCNT QD) transistors. Because these devices are so short, we can observe fundamental mesoscopic physics which has not yet been explored, and engineer tuneable nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and ultra-short transistors.\nContrary to what has been observed in longer SWCNT devices, we observe strong electron-hole asymmetry in charge transport, due to charge doping from the metallic leads. This asymmetry manifests itself as a striking difference between electron and hole conductance regimes (0D to 1D transport), and in the charging energy of our QDs (up to a factor of 3). The magnitude of the asymmetry depends on the bandgap and length of the SWCNT.\nSuspended SWCNTs can strongly couple to their electrostatic environment through the bending mode, and act as NEMS sensors. Shorter NEMS have higher frequencies and therefore higher sensitivity. By creating very short devices, we observe bending mode frequencies up to ≈ 280 GHz, and tune this frequency by electrostatic strain. We clearly resolve the first and second harmonic of the bending mode and extract their effective coupling to be γ eff ~ 103\nIn high conductance devices, we observe a strong Kondo effect, with Kondo temperatures up to TK ≈ 28 K. In devices combining Kondo and the bending mode, we measure a large reduction in charging energy, to the point of complete suppression. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that charging energy renormalization has been observed in SWCNTs.\nAndrew McRae \nAugust 20, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nModeling and Characterization of Protein Energy Landscapes at Low Temperatures using Hole Burning Spectroscopy\nProteins are playing various important roles in living organisms. Understanding the way they can perform different tasks is a demanding goal for scientists. Some flexibility is essential for proper functioning of proteins, and knowledge about both static structures and dynamics is essential for understanding them. One of the tools for studying proteins is optical spectroscopy. However, proteins are almost incapable of light absorption in the visible range which makes them non reachable for direct measurements; therefore, indirect methods should be applied. Pigment embedded into (amorphous) solid can serve as a local reporter on static and dynamic properties of its environment. Using proteins with pigments embedded into them by Nature offers a good alternative to introducing local reporters by chemical or genetic manipulations. In our study we focus on pigment-protein complexes involved in photosynthesis. In the first half we report several improvements to techniques of measuring the parameters of proteins energy landscapes. We prove that tunneling is responsible for both thermally- and light-induced spectral diffusion in photosynthetic proteins at low temperatures, that distributions of barriers on the protein energy landscape are likely Gaussian as well as make some suggestions concerning entities involved in tunneling. The reasoning by which we arrive to Gaussian barrier distributions is not specific to proteins, which results in us questioning some theories of glasses and other amorphous solids at low temperatures, and the quality of measurements supporting these theories. In the second half we introduce new approach to modeling spectral diffusion, which includes the light-induced one. Modeling results appear to be in reasonable agreement with the experiment. Importantly, we demonstrate that samples used in spectroscopy experiments on proteins must be fairly far from thermodynamic equilibrium.\nMehdi Najafi \nAugust 14, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectronic transport in low dimensional systems\nRecent technological advancements have made it possible to fabricate electronic systems smaller and smaller, and as the dimensions of electronic components become comparable to quantum length scales the electronic transport properties are changed significantly. In the last few decades there has been intensive study on low dimensional electronic systems to explore new candidates for micro- and nanoelectronics to have future electronic devices that are faster, smaller, and have a range of new capabilities not possible with current technology. In this talk we present a review on the effects of electron confinement on systems such as quantum dots, quantum wires and quantum wells with examples of cutting edge fabricated devices. Different electronic transport regimes and quantum length scales will be discussed and we summarize the electronic transport of low dimensional systems including the reported data on GaAs/AlGaAs interfaces, carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets and Topological Insulator crystals.\nVahid Tayari \nMay 24, 2013 -- 1 pm -- Room CC 101\nHigh Resolution Spectroscopy\nHigh resolution spectroscopy methods are novel tools that enable one to uncover a narrow, homogeneous spectral line from an inhomogeneous broadened spectrum at low temperatures. In this seminar fundamentals of absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation as well as basics of optical spectra will be presented. Several interesting examples of single molecule spectroscopy in physics and life sciences will be included.\nNicoleta Herascu \nApril 10, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room CC 101\nQuantum ballistic conduction through quasi-one-dimensional wires\nPhase-coherent electron transport through quasi-one-dimensional systems has developed into a very active and fascinating subfield of mesoscopic physics. We present a review of this development focusing on ballistic conduction through quantum wires (or constrictions). In quantum wires the electron conductance versus Fermi energy is quantized as a consequence of the reduced dimensionality and the subsequent quantization of transverse momentum. The presence of scatterers in otherwise clean wires can strongly suppress the quantum conductance, and can generate sharp resonances (which are due to quasibound states) if the scattering potential is attractive. These resonances can be either Fano or Breit-Wigner type, depending on the size and/or strength of the scattering potential. Finite temperature effects are also considered. In the ballistic limit we present the derivation of the Landauer formula, which is the basic tool for calculating the conductance of a mesoscopic sample. Scattering in ballistic quantum wires is formulated in terms of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The Feshbach coupled-channel theory is employed in order to treat Fano resonances.\nDr. Vassilios Vargiamidis \nApril 3, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nViruses as Building Blocks for Materials and Devices\nSignificant challenges exist in assembling the building blocks of a nanoscale device. Self-assembly is one of the few practical strategies for making ensembles of nanostructures and will therefore be an essential part of nanotechnology. In order to generate complex structures through self-assembly, it is essential to develop methods by which different components in solution can come together in an ordered fashion. As biological interactions are better understood, there has been interest in using the specificity and strong interactions present in biology to organize and orient inorganic components to create new materials. Using viruses as nanoscale scaffolds for materials and devices offers the promise of exquisite control over positioning nanoscale components on a protein scaffold that also allows further self-assembly of the resulting constructs. I will discuss the successful use of viruses both as scaffolds for nanoscale devices such as electronic nanosensors as well as to produce optically active plasmonic components.\nDr. Amy Szuchmacher Blum \nMarch 27, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room CC 116\nNano-scale confinement enables new kinds of biophysical measurements\nA wide range of physiological processes rely on weak intermolecular interactions that occur at high concentrations, or over long time periods. Probing such interactions presents a challenge to fluorescence microscopy, the work horse for resolving biological processes at the molecular scale. To address this challenge, we develop new microscopy methodologies which, by imposing nano-scale confinement, enable new biophysical measurements under previously inaccessible conditions. We report on two biophysical experiments which apply these technologies. First, we perform precision spectroscopy on the behaviour of DNA under nano-scale confinement. We employ tuneable imaging chambers which combine gentle and localized (lithography-based) confinement, yielding new approaches to controlling and aligning DNA for optical interrogation. Second, we image the procession of myosin motor proteins in nano-scale chambers, motivated by measuring the chemo-mechanocoupling between ATP-uptake and motor procession along actin tracks, with enhanced background suppression.\nDr. Sabrina Leslie \nMarch 21, 2013 -- 2 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nQuantum Information Science and Technology: when tiny things do big things\nTwo landmark theories that emerged in the 20th century forever changed our world: quantum mechanics and information theory. The first altered our perception of reality; the second enabled the information age of today. Quantum Information Science and Technology bridge these theories by probing deep questions about information and reality, and by developing the transformative technologies of tomorrow. This talk will overview the basic concepts of Quantum Information Science and Technology and its applications to computing, communication and sensing. The current state of itsphysical realization using nuclear and electronic spins, photons, superconductor and semiconductors will also be explored.\nDr. Martin Laforest \nMarch 20, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nStrategies for Controlled Assembly at the Nanoscale\nThe bottomup approach is considered a potential alternative for low cost manufacturing of nanostructured materials. It is based on the concept of selfassembly of nanostructures on a substrate, and is emerging as an alternative paradigm for traditional top down fabrication used in the semiconductor industry.\nWe demonstrate various strategies to control nanostructure assembly (both organic and inorganic) at the nanoscale. Depending on the specific material system under investigation, we developed various approaches, which include, in particular: (i) deposition on naturally patterned substrates, which exploit longrange reconstructions that can be used to control the adsorption of organic molecules; (ii) we can control the size and luminescence properties of semiconductor nanostructures, synthesized by reactive laser ablation; (iii) we developed new experimental tools and comparison with simulations are presented to gain atomic scale insight into the surface processes that govern nucleation, growth and assembly; (iv) by controlling inter-molecular interactions, we create specific nanoscale patterns including guest/host architectures; (v) we developed a simple surface modification strategy for biomaterials which enhances biocompatibility; (vi) we devised new strategies for synthesizing multifunctional nanoscale materials to be used for electronics, photovoltaics and catalysis.\nExploiting surface cues, surface mediated interactions, intermolecular forces and moleculesurface interactions we demonstrated the formation of long range ordered patterns in a variety of nanoscale systems, which are potentially interesting for a variety of applications in electronics, biomedicine and energy.\nDr. Federico Rosei \nMarch 13, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nMapping molecular interactions and transport in cells with image correlation spectroscopy & fluorescence fluctuation analysis\nImage correlation methods provide a new window of analysis for measurement of protein-protein interactions and macromolecular transport properties from fluorescence images of living cells. These approaches are based on space and time correlation analysis of fluctuations in fluorescence intensity within images recorded as a time series on a laser scanning or total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. We recently introduced spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) which measures vectors of protein flux in cells based on the calculation of a spatial correlation function as a function of time from an image time series. Here we will describe the application of STICS and its two color extension, spatio-temporal image cross-correlation spectroscopy (STICCS), for measuring transport maps of adhesion related macromolecules such as integrin, alpha-actinin, paxillin, talin, and vinculin within, or associated with the basal membrane in living fibroblast and CHO cells. These measurements have allowed us to propose a model for the molecular clutch that regulates connections between the extracellular matrix, integrins in the membrane and the cytoskeleton during cell protrusion and migration\nWe will also illustrate the mapping of cytoskeletal dynamics within the growth cones of migrating neurons using STICS. Finally we will also highlight recent advances we have made with a new form of reciprocal (k-) space ICS, called kICS, that allows us to measure unbiased transport coefficients of fluorescently labeled membrane proteins even if there is complex photophysics (such as nanoparticle emission blinking) of the probe.\nWe will describe kICS measurements of the transport properties of quantum dot labeled receptors in the cell membrane as well as determination of clustering properties of QD labeled receptors based on kICS correlation studies of changes in the nanoparticle blinking.\nDr. Paul W. Wiseman \nMarch 6, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nResearch in Quantum Nonlinear Optics\nNonlinear optics is a venerable branch of photonics and optical physics, dating back certainly to 1961 or even earlier. Nonetheless, the field of nonlinear optics has recently experienced a renaissance by means of its application to problems in quantum information science and quantum optics. In this talk, I first present a very rapid overview of the development of the field of nonlinear optics and then move on the survey some areas of recent research interest.\nOne such example is research in slow and fast light. Research performed over the past several years has demonstrated new methods for controlling the velocity of propagation of light pulses through material systems. Ultra slow velocities (tens of meters per second) and ultrafast velocities (including negative velocities) have been demonstrated. This talk will present an overview of the field of slow and fast light and will include a discussion of some new ideas for applications of fast and slow light based on the use of room temperature solids.\nAnother topic of great current interest is that of quantum imaging. Image formation making use of quantum states of light allow dramatic new possibilities in the field of image science. We review some of the conceptual possibilities afforded by quantum imaging and describe some recent work that displays some of these features. In addition, we present some new experimental results on the role of coherence and indistinguishability in determining the properties of two-photon interference.\nDr. Robert W. Boyd \nUniversity of Ottawa & University of Rochester\nFebruary 27, 2013 -- 3 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nElectrolyte gating as a platform to control the conductivity of nanostructured thin films\nElectrolyte gating relies on the use of electrolytes as gating media to modulate the conductivity of semiconducting thin films.\nThe principle of electrolyte gating is known since almost 60 years, having been used in the early works of Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain. Electrolyte-gated transistors consist of source and drain electrodes and a channel containing the semiconducting material in ionic contact with a gate electrode via an electrolyte solution, which replaces the gate dielectric used in more usual field-effect transistor structure. In electrolyte-gated organic transistors the application of a gate voltage induces the formation of an electrical double layer (EDL) at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface. EDL capacitances per unit areas are in the order of 10 μFcm-2 and can be as high as 500 μFcm-2, whereas the typical capacitance of a 200 nm-thick SiO2 dielectric is of the order of tens of nFcm-2.\nElectrolyte gating is used to fabricate transistors operating at low voltage (below 1 V) as an alternative to other approaches such the use of high-k, or ultrathin gate dielectrics.\nDespite the tremendous progress in the field, the physics behind the electrolyte gating phenomenon, in particular the specific effect of a certain ionic liquid on the conductivity modulation, is largely undiscovered.\nHere we report on electrolyte-gated transistors based on organic (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene, MEH-PPV, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM) and inorganic (ZnO, WO3) solution-processed thin films and making use, as the electrolyte, of different ionic liquids (BMIM-PF6, BMIM-TFSI, EMIM-TFSI). A tentative correlation between the effectiveness of the gating and the conductivity, viscosity, and ion size of the ionic liquids is proposed.\nDr. Clara Santato \nFebruary 19, 2013 -- 10:00 am -- Room SP 365.01\nMixed Plasmonic Nanoparticles for Enhanced-Performance Organic Solar Cells\nPhotovoltaics (PVs) are considered as a promising approach to provide renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources. Ease of process, low-cost, light-weight, optical tenability, recyclability and mechanical flexibility makes organic solar cells (OSCs) a competitive choice in comparison with the currently dominating inorganic polycrystalline and Si-based devices. To commercialize the polymer PVs, however, higher efficiencies are required. One recent approach is the incorporation of noble-metal nanoparticles (MNPs) in OSCs which could significantly contribute to the performance of the devices through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. The characteristics of plasmonic modes could be adjusted by tuning the shape and/or size of the incorporated MNPs in order to maximize the light harvesting efficiency of photoactive material.\nThe current work presents efficiency-enhanced OSCs using either gold nanorods (Au NRs), silver nanospheres (Ag NSs) or a dual plasmonic nanostructure consisting of Au NRs mixed with Ag NSs. In this method, each MNP contributes to the photocurrent and efficiency of OSCs depending on its size, shape and absorption spectra. A comparative study has been made between the characteristics of plasmonic devices by taking advantage of various characterization techniques. The similarity and differences of the results were investigated and the effects of integrating each type of MNPs on the overall electrical and optical performance of OSCs were discussed in detail. A remarkable increase of 30% in power conversion efficiency of plasmonic OSCs could be achieved using a mixture of Au NRs and Ag NSs.\nNeda Etebari Alamdari \nPOSTPONED UNTIL A LATER DATE\nQuantum Matter \"On-a-chip\"!\nQuantum physical phenomena are inherently different in dimensions lower than 3D. For instance, one can observe bizarre electronic quantum states in 2D with the properties of charge fractionalization, and in even lower dimension (1D) one can observe the conductance of a wire to be given by a single quantum corresponding to G=2e^2/h.\nIn this talk,I will describe a few low temperature experiments, all performed on some sort of a \"chip\", with the hope to elucidate bizarre quantum phenomena. These include:\nour effort to detect bizarre particles that are neither boson or fermion, in 2D\nthe 1D-1D Coulomb drag of electrons in two closed-pack quantum wires, separated by only ~15 nm,\na nano-engineered quantum faucet (for real fluids!) and\nan extreme microscope that can take pretty pictures in 16 tesla and at a temperature of 100 mK.\nIt's a lot of (quantum) fun!\nDr. Guillaume Gervais \nJanuary 23, 2013 -- 3:00 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nExploring nature's smallest scale using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider\nOne hundred years after the Bohr model of the atom and the publication of Millikan's seminal paper on the determination of the charge of an electron, the question of what matter is made of remains one of the leading science question. A significant research breakthrough occurred in 2012 with the discovery of the existence of a new particle, with a mass approximately 250,000 times heavier than an electron. Preliminary studies indicate that this new particle exhibits properties similar to those expected from the long-sought Higgs boson. This talk will describe how this new particle was discovered using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and prospects for detailed measurements of its properties.\nDr. Brigitte Vachon \nJanuary 16, 2013 -- 3:00 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nImaging, spectroscopy and manipulation by Atomic Force Microscopy\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a technique that allows atomic scale spatial resolution on essentially any material, including insulators and metals, in essentially any environment ranging from ultra high vacuum to liquids, at temperatures of several 100K down to mK. Many properties, such as electrical surface potential, mechanical stress, adhesion or friction can be measured at the same length scale, often as a function of external parameters such as light or electrochemical potential. Completing this 'nanolab' is the capability of AFM to manipulate objects. In this presentation I will explore several examples from research in my group to illustrate these capabilities. I will concentrate on three topics:\n1. We have used Ultra High Vacuum AFM integrated in a surface science system to understand and control the nucleation and growth of molecules on insulating surfaces. We can generate different molecular packing structures by suitable templating of the insulating substrates. This then allows us to correlate optical properties with structure using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, including molecular systems relevant to organic photovoltaics (OPV) by shining light on the sample. Preliminary results indicate that we can observe exciton formation in model OPV systems.\n2. AFM can be used to measure the ground state and excited state energy levels of quantum dots, and possibly molecules, by understanding dissipation of the AFM cantilever. AFM techniques can also be used to measure variations in the surface potential on semiconductors and oxide surfaces. We discovered large variation of the surface potential (~250 mV) on length scales of 50 nm. Such large potential variations are expected to strongly affect the operation of nanoscale electronic systems or possibly even adsorption of molecular species.\n3. Finally, I will demonstrate how AFM manipulation techniques in combination with optical microscopy techniques can be used to study axonal degeneration as a result of (localized) trauma, synapse formation dynamics or even enable neuronal engineering by connecting axons with an AFM.\nDr. Peter Grutter \nJanuary 9, 2013 -- 3:00 pm -- Room SP 365.01\nAn Overview of ConSiM (Concordia Silicon Microfabrication Facility) and Optical BioMEMS Lab\nThis presentation will present an overview and outline of recent research activities and possible potential collaborations in the areas of microsystems, microfabrication, BioMEMS and Micro-Nano Integration. The results on many micro-nano devices for varied applications will be presented. Some of the applications include physical sensing, cellular, enzyme and polypeptide diagnosis, photosynthetic power cells, antigen-antibody based biochips, biomechanical interaction based analysis for enzymatic and cellular applications, and various levels of microfluidic-photonics integration and micro-nano integration methods.\nDr. Muthukumaran Packirisamy \n"}

In 2015–16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity .\nThe series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.\n“Last year really exceeded our expectations,” says André Roy , dean of FAS. “So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.”\nOn Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season, “ Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,” invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations.\nHeld in collaboration with Concordia’s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes .\nAccording to Roy, this year’s series won’t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A. “We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.”\nClaudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public.\nGauthier’s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age. “I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,” she explains.\n‘Thinking outside the box’\nFellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.\n“I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,” says Chapman. “I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.”\nAnother first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS.

From astronomy to culinary chemistry, these educational offerings will whet your appetite\nPosted on September 20, 2016\n|\nBy: Meagan Boisse\n“Did you enjoy The Martian? If so, we may have a course for you.” | Image: Twentieth Century Fox\nIn celebration of Science Literacy Week (Sept. 19-25), the Concordia news desk is highlighting a related activity every day. See Monday's Wiki for women in STEM!  and Wednesday's  Rocketry and robotics at Space Concordia .\nSo you’re not a scientist. But like anyone with an inquisitive mind, you still grapple with life’s existential questions: Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? How close to reality is Jurassic Park?\nGood news! You don’t need be an expert to explore the realms of science and space. Concordia offers a myriad of courses that address some of these fundamental queries while exploring a range of subjects, from the vast expanses of the universe to the tiniest life-giving particles.\n \nGeneral Biology\n“Do you want to know why you need to eat food and breathe oxygen? The difference between science and pseudoscience? Or what your ancient ancestors looked like? Then General Biology is for you,” says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , who teaches BIOL 202: General Biology.\nThe course covers the fundamentals of biology and the chemistry of life. Learn about the structure and functions of cells and tissues, as well as aspects of anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, heredity and evolution.\n“It’s designed for non-scientists who are still curious about life. Through it you will learn the makings of life using everyday examples,” says Gray-Mitsumune.\n \nFundamental Nutrition\nWhere does cooking and science collide? In BIOL 203: Fundamental Nutrition, of course, where you’ll take a hands-on approach to food composition.\n“Cooking teaches us food chemistry. Thankfully, every home still comes equipped with a kitchen,” says instructor Catherine Calogeropoulos , who teaches her students the science of nutrition through an array of culinary experiments.\nCan you use milk in a sauce recipe that calls for cream? Probably not, says Calogeropoulos. Relative to milk, cream contains a lot less protein. Under high heat, milk can cause the sauce to curdle — and make you look like a foolish foodie.\n“Science reveals itself magically before our eyes in the kitchen. By perusing the molecular gastronomy literature I’ve found perfect cooking examples to anchor nearly all the scientific concepts that might elude my students and senior auditors,” she says.\n \nFundamentals of Health and Physical Activity\nThis course touches upon a range of topics: cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, weight management, nutrition, disease prevention and even stress management.\n“Students will gain both knowledge and tools to maximize their health and energy, immediately and in the long term,” says instructor Leslie Barker, who teaches EXCI 251: Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity.\n“Many students comment that EXCI 251 helped them improve their own negative eating, smoking, stress and inactivity habits, while they also learned to differentiate between scientific facts and marketing hype,” adds Barker.\n \nForensic Analysis\nEveryone knows that DNA analysis revolutionized forensics, but how? If you want to find out,  Cameron Skinner , associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, suggests you take CHEM 298 AA.\n“Our approach is to first learn the underlying principles by starting with the basics such as molecules, chemical reactions and so on, before working our way towards the sophisticated tools used in a modern forensics lab,” says Skinner.\n“You will finish the course with a more realistic understanding of the field of forensics. You'll also understand the capacities and limitations of modern analysis. Some of the lessons will be case studies, some will be drawn from the textbook ... and there will be an occasional poisoning and/or murder.”\nPlease note: Skinner says he will not take responsibility for any damages or strife caused when you begin yelling at your TV during crime shows such as CSI.\n \nDiscovering Biotechnology\n“Did you enjoy The Martian?  Were you thrilled by Jurassic Park?  Did Gattaca give you pause for thought? If so, we may have a course for you,” says Paul Joyce , a professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Concordia.\nCHEM 209: Discovering Biotechnology begins with an exploration of the roles that genes and proteins play in life processes.\nIt then examines the basic principles behind the manipulation of biological molecules to produce desired changes. The course also explores the ethical ramifications of such actions.\n“Would you like to know how close we are to establishing a base on Mars? Or if we can really clone dinosaurs (or people, for that matter)? Or how close we are to the spectre of genetic discrimination?” asks Joyce. “Then register for this course.”\n \nIntroduction to Astronomy\nBlack holes, constellations, the Milky Way galaxy and beyond — PHYS 284: Introduction to Astronomy is the course for anyone interested in space.\n“Students will be introduced to advanced topics from cosmology, including the Big Bang theory, as well as the study of extra-solar planets and the search for extraterrestrial life,” says Mario D’Amico from Concordia’s Department of Physics.\nPHYS 284 will be offered as an online course this winter session. Browse through multimedia components and narrated lectures on major topics in astronomy, from the comfort of your own couch.\n“Students will have the flexibility of taking the course using their computers. They will therefore not be required to travel, or even be located in Montreal,” adds D'Amico.\n \nRegister online through the MyConcordia portal for these classes. Space is limited.\n \n"}

One way is to change the way we teach.\nThis is exactly what Catherine Calogeropoulos , a part-time instructor in Concordia's Department of Biology , is doing with her “BIOL 203 - Fundamental Nutrition” course. Her challenge? Figuring out a way to make complicated scientific concepts understandable to non-science students. Enter the professional chef.\nTo accompany each lesson, Calogeropoulos shows a video segment of a seasoned cook preparing a meal that supports the concept of the day. “The cooking reinforces the chemistry,” she explains. “It’s easier to understand how lipids work by seeing how mayonnaise is made.”\nBut the course isn’t just about understanding science fundamentals. “It's also about learning vital life skills. I want my students to come away from my course enjoying cooking and knowing how to make healthy, sustainable, inexpensive meals.”\n‘My hope is to stir interest in science’\nChanging the way we teach isn’t just about providing students with alternative ways to digest tough material; it’s also about adapting the way we approach the classroom experience.\nMario D’Amico , a part-time professor in the Department of Physics , teaches “PHYS 298 - Introduction to Astronomy,” a blended course on the foundations of the discipline.\nFor his elective, which attracts students ranging in age from 18 to 80, D’Amico finds the flexibility of the blended approach an advantage. “Attendance to the lecture portion is optional,” he explains. “So those with time or travel constraints can learn most of the course on their computers.”\nThe environment also offers flexibility in the way students can complete their work. “Using online assignments with computer-generated marks and feedback allows them the opportunity to retry questions they get wrong.” This helps those without a science background learn difficult concepts while still keeping their grades up.\nTaking D’Amico’s course is about more than just getting a passing grade to fulfill an elective. “We are at the dawn of space exploration and at the frontiers of scientific innovation,” he says. “My hope is to stir interest in science, physics and astronomy while ensuring that students enjoy a very relaxed experience.”\n \nFor more blended learning opportunities at Concordia, check out Concordia's first ever Massive Open Online Course .\n \n"}

There were 21 people with 20 years of service, 46 with 25 years, 19 with 30 years, 27 with 35 years, 11 with 40 years, nine with 45 years, three with a remarkable 50 years, as well as 117 retirees.\nBenoit-Antoine Bacon , Concordia’s provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, congratulated staff and faculty for their dedicated service.\nHe joked about trying to “wrap his head around” the fact that some of those being honoured had worked at Concordia when the Beatles were new on the pop music scene.\n“Thank you to everyone who has built Concordia into the amazing place that it is today,” said Bacon. “Everyone’s unique contribution over the years has given us our character today.”\nJune S. Chaikelson, 50 years at Concordia. | All photos by Concordia University\nAlan Shepard , the university’s president, noted that  Manfred \"Fred\" Szabo  was celebrating his 51st year of service as a professor in the  Department of Mathematics and Statistics , while  June S. Chaikelson , a professor in the  Department of Psychology , and  Barry Frank , a professor in the  Department of Physics , were just one year behind, at 50 years of service.\n“After so many years the sense of bond we have with each other is strong,” said Shepard, before outlining Concordia’s  strategic directions .\n“Maybe we met a mate here, sent our children to university here, and made deep connections. Concordia is ultimately about people, not buildings … As retirees, you’re still ambassadors, so please continue to spread the word about Concordia and the new strategic directions that make us a next-generation university.”\nRepresenting the honourees, Eric Goldner, a manager of  Student Recruitment , took the microphone to discuss his experience growing up with a father who worked as a counsellor at Concordia.\nGoldner Jr. went on to contribute his own 25 years of service, and counting.\n“Now, as a student recruiter, when I tell prospective students and their parents about our long-term service, it resonates well,” said Goldner, who has held seven jobs in seven different departments across campus.\n“Each of us plays a part, and it wouldn’t be the same without your contribution and commitment to the evolution of Concordia.”\nPeter Shizgal, 40 years at Concordia. \"It's gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.\"\nCheryl Williams, a retired department assistant from the  Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema , was among the honourees. Over the years, she has enjoyed following the careers of graduates, including feature film director Christian Duguay and animator Chris Hinton.\n“Sometimes, it felt like I had 300 kids,” laughed Williams, who served for 30 years.\n“The animators and film studies students are quiet, while the film production students are more outgoing. I’ll miss them all.”\nAnother honouree, Peter Shizgal , a professor of psychology, is celebrating 40 years of service. Like Williams, he enjoys the collegial nature of his department.\n“The department was on the rise when I started, and my area — behavioural neurobiology — really took off,” he said. “It’s gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.”\nShizgal has no plans to retire. He will continue to focus his research on reward and decision making. “I have a grant that doesn’t run out until 2018, and I’ve applied to renew a grant that I’ve had since 1976. It would provide funding until 2021.”\nVenkat Ramachandran, 45 years at Concordia. \"I'm proud to have been a part of that.\"\nVenkat Ramachandran , a professor from the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , is celebrating 45 years at Concordia. His son followed his footsteps, studying electrical engineering at Concordia, and now teaches at Rowan University in New Jersey.\n“The department expanded and made a name for itself,” said Ramachandran, who has 21 academic awards in research, teaching, administration and engineering education.\n“I’m proud to have been a part of that.”\nRead more about  Concordia staff who were honoured  in 2015.\n \n"}

The event will occur between about 7:12 a.m. and 2:42 p.m. EDT on May 9. | Image courtesy of NASA\nMario D’Amico is a part-time professor in Concordia’s Department of Physics , who teaches the new “PHYS 284 - Introduction to Astronomy” course.\nA planet — a wanderer in the sky as its etymology suggests — generally moves along its orbit without much adulation. However, on occasion, given rare but re-occurring conditions, it performs an acrobatic feat calling out for our attention.\nMercury, the most eccentric of wanderers, will be performing such a feat on May 9.\nLike Mercury, the messenger of the Roman gods — also the patron god of money, luck and thievery — who’s often depicted wearing winged shoes to convey his speed, Mercury the planet is swift, metallic and can be deceivingly cold.\nAt night, temperatures on Mercury can reach -173 C, despite its proximity to the Sun. It is the closest planet to the Sun, the smallest and has the fastest orbital velocity of any planet. Mercury is also known for its high orbital eccentricity (not to be confused with the word “eccentric” — although somewhat related). Eccentricity is a measure of how much a planet’s orbit deviates from a perfect circle. Mercury is the planet with the most elliptical orbital of them all.\nAnother special feature of Mercury relative to us Earthlings is that Mercury is one of two inner planets — the other is Venus. From our perspective on Earth, inner planets are interesting because they occasionally pass directly between us and the Sun, forming an eclipse of sorts referred to as a planetary transit.\nOn May 9, Mercury will pass between Earth and the Sun — or, as is stated in astronomy-speak, “Mercury will pass through inferior conjunction” with the Sun.\n \nPlanetary transits follow the same physical dynamics as a solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the moon passes between the Sun and Earth. For an eclipse or a transit to occur, two conditions must be met: the object (planet or moon) must pass between Earth and the Sun, and the object must intersect Earth’s orbital plane.\nA way to imagine these two conditions, in the case of a solar eclipse, is to think of the moon positioned between the Sun and Earth. Clearly it is not enough for the moon to be in between — it must also be high enough along its orbital inclination to obscure the Sun’s rays. This only happens a few times a year.\nIn the case of Mercury, there are only two times of the year (May and November) when Mercury’s orbital plane intersects Earth’s orbital plane. At these two times of the year, a transit could occur if, in addition to the orbits crossing, Mercury passes between Earth and the Sun — a rare event estimated at around 13 transits in 100 years.\nLike a solar eclipse, viewing planetary transits depends on the geolocation of the viewer . Another aspect of eclipses shared by transits is that viewing must be done with care. In the case of a Mercury transit, you would have to look directly at the sun. This could be harmful if not approached with caution. A technique used to avoid direct viewing is to project the image from a telescope or binoculars onto a sheet of paper .\nAs interesting as it may be, and as much as Mercury calls for your attention, if you are unable to see this year’s transit (the third Mercury transit of this century), do not despair. You will soon have another opportunity.\nMercury will continue its flight as messenger to the gods while preparing for its next performance in 2019.\nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Physics .\n \n"}

Latimer\nPERFORM Centre researcher Claudine Gauthier: \"We hope that the techniques we use in this project will be helpful to doctors in the future.\"\nIt has been a good term for Concordia's  Claudine Gauthier . \nThe assistant professor in the  Department of Physics  won the national Heart and Stroke Foundation New Investigator Award for 2015-16, as well as the foundation’s Henry J.M. Barnett Scholarship.\nThe new investigator award supports individuals who have demonstrated excellence in their pre- and postdoctoral training and wish to establish their own research laboratory.\n“I feel very lucky to have the support of Concordia and the Heart and Stroke Foundation, to be able to make exciting research happen,” says Gauthier. \nClaudine Gauthier\nGauthier has been busy developing her ideas and techniques for several years, and says she's enthusiastic for the chance to begin her research in earnest.\n\"Translational health research is very important and a key part of the Concordia and PERFORM Centre mission. I am happy I can help spearhead these efforts with my research ideas.”  \nHere, Gauthier answers some questions about her work.\nIs it unusual for a physicist to win the Heart and Stroke Foundation New Investigator Award?\nClaudine Gauthier: It’s unusual for traditional physicists, yes. But biomedical sciences are an important component of technical development in health research. Physicists are often behind the development of new technologies for measuring novel components of health, and this is the type of work I do.\nI develop new methods and combine existing technical developments to measure novel aspects of brain health. But typically, it does go more often to clinical scientists.\nTell us about your work.\nCG: I use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to develop new markers of vascular and metabolic health in the brain. These can be used to understand the impact of cardiovascular diseases on the brain, and the link between cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline and the impact of lifestyle on these interactions.\nMy work in the past has mostly been on the development of these techniques. In my application to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, I proposed to take the next step and use them to study patient populations.\nWhy is this important, now?\nCG: The World Health Organization estimates that one third of deaths in high-income countries are due to chronic vascular diseases. In these diseases, arteries throughout the body are affected and become stiffer. This effect on the arteries is thought to extend to the brain and be associated with damage to all brain cell types.\nThis damage due to stiffer arteries may be partly responsible for the cognitive decline observed in populations with vascular diseases. Because people can live for a long time with these diseases, this damage to the brain progresses over years and may significantly reduce quality of life and lead to other neurological and neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia.\nExercise can help prevent and treat these conditions, but we do not know what the biological impact of exercise on the brain is, and how it interacts with disease.\nFinding clinical strategies to improve brain health depends on our ability to measure the complex biological causes of the disease itself and of the changes that follow treatment or prevention. Non-invasive imaging strategies that capture the health of all brain cellular compartments are needed to obtain crucial information about brain health and the brain’s ability to recover from the changes that precede irreversible damage, allowing us to better design treatment strategies.\nWhat’s the overall objective?\nCG: The objective is to understand the link between cardiovascular health and disease, and brain health, at the level of both blood vessels and tissue. Because vascular lesions typically occur in the white matter (the cellular compartment that ensures rapid and efficient communication within the brain), there will be a focus on the health of this tissue compartment.\nHow does the PERFORM Centre come into play?\nCG: This project will also investigate the impact of cardiovascular and brain health on cognition. Finally, we will investigate the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., how much oxygen one can use during exercise) on brain health and cognition, to see how exercise can act to modify the effect of heart and cerebrovascular disease.\nThis fits in well with PERFORM's mission to expand our knowledge of and promote healthy lifestyles for improving population health, since my techniques can help us develop better preventative strategies.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is both a non-invasive and highly versatile tool that can be used repeatedly to obtain a variety of information about brain health. The brain health components we will study are however difficult to measure using conventional MRI techniques. Therefore, our objective is to use recent developments in MRI to devise a state-of-the-art imaging protocol to measure brain vascular and tissue health in a novel and comprehensive way.\nWhat does your work add to the field?\nCG: Because many Canadians live with heart disease for decades, the impact of this disease on other organs such as the brain becomes an integral component of heart disease itself.\nFurthermore, it is this damage to the brain, brought by an unhealthy heart and arteries, that increases the likelihood of developing a stroke. At this time, it is very difficult to measure the small damage to the brain that precedes strokes or other types of lesions, and characterizes the vulnerable area around strokes. The work we propose will contribute to the technical development necessary to measure the changes that precede and surround this irreversible damage.\nUnderstanding the changes that precede damage will allow us to better understand the disease itself, but more importantly, will allow us to devise better strategies for prevention and treatment of brain vascular lesions.\nThe program proposed includes three interrelated quantitative MRI studies. These studies will allow a comprehensive understanding of the link between cardiovascular disease and neurovascular health in its larger sense, encompassing all essential components of brain health.\nThese projects represent the most comprehensive and integrated effort to date to understand the impact of heart disease on brain health and the role of exercise in improving brain health using MRI.\nYou also won the Henry J.M. Barnett Scholarship, one of two possible supplementary prizes awarded to a highly rated national new investigator working in stroke or a related field. Did you win that award on the basis of the same work described above?\nCG: Yes. My work spans the entire spectrum from healthy older adults to older adults with cardiovascular risk factors and those with overt cardiovascular disease and stroke. The prize is awarded partly for my work on strokes.\nIn this part of my program, I look at the changes in brain metabolism associated with the stroke and following the course of recovery during the first week after the stroke. This is important because we think metabolism around the stroke is important in determining if that part of the brain will survive over the long term.\nBut measuring this using existing techniques is very difficult, so this information cannot typically be used to make an informed diagnosis and treatment decisions. We hope that the techniques we use in this project will be helpful to doctors in the future. This is a project done in collaboration with Charité Hospital in Berlin.\nWhat will you use the $10,000 from the Barnett Scholarship to fund?\nCG: It will pay for part of a student's salary to work on the stroke project, and it will cover some travel to further the collaboration with the Charité team.\nFind out more about Concordia's PERFORM Centre .\n \n"}

In 2015–16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity .\nThe series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.\n“Last year really exceeded our expectations,” says André Roy , dean of FAS. “So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.”\nOn Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season, “ Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,” invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations.\nHeld in collaboration with Concordia’s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes .\nAccording to Roy, this year’s series won’t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A. “We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.”\nClaudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public.\nGauthier’s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age. “I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,” she explains.\n‘Thinking outside the box’\nFellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.\n“I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,” says Chapman. “I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.”\nAnother first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the “Come to your senses” event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .\n“I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,” explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .\n“I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.”\nRoy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.\n“We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats. As great as last year was, I am confident this one will be even better.”\nThe other speakers at this fall’s first Beyond Disciplines event are:\n"}

From astronomy to culinary chemistry, these educational offerings will whet your appetite\nPosted on September 20, 2016\n|\nBy: Meagan Boisse\n“Did you enjoy The Martian? If so, we may have a course for you.” | Image: Twentieth Century Fox\nIn celebration of Science Literacy Week (Sept. 19-25), the Concordia news desk is highlighting a related activity every day. See Monday's Wiki for women in STEM!  and Wednesday's  Rocketry and robotics at Space Concordia .\nSo you’re not a scientist. But like anyone with an inquisitive mind, you still grapple with life’s existential questions: Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? How close to reality is Jurassic Park?\nGood news! You don’t need be an expert to explore the realms of science and space. Concordia offers a myriad of courses that address some of these fundamental queries while exploring a range of subjects, from the vast expanses of the universe to the tiniest life-giving particles.\n \nGeneral Biology\n“Do you want to know why you need to eat food and breathe oxygen? The difference between science and pseudoscience? Or what your ancient ancestors looked like? Then General Biology is for you,” says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , who teaches BIOL 202: General Biology.\nThe course covers the fundamentals of biology and the chemistry of life. Learn about the structure and functions of cells and tissues, as well as aspects of anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, heredity and evolution.\n“It’s designed for non-scientists who are still curious about life. Through it you will learn the makings of life using everyday examples,” says Gray-Mitsumune.\n \nFundamental Nutrition\nWhere does cooking and science collide? In BIOL 203: Fundamental Nutrition, of course, where you’ll take a hands-on approach to food composition.\n“Cooking teaches us food chemistry. Thankfully, every home still comes equipped with a kitchen,” says instructor Catherine Calogeropoulos , who teaches her students the science of nutrition through an array of culinary experiments.\nCan you use milk in a sauce recipe that calls for cream? Probably not, says Calogeropoulos. Relative to milk, cream contains a lot less protein. Under high heat, milk can cause the sauce to curdle — and make you look like a foolish foodie.\n“Science reveals itself magically before our eyes in the kitchen. By perusing the molecular gastronomy literature I’ve found perfect cooking examples to anchor nearly all the scientific concepts that might elude my students and senior auditors,” she says.\n \nFundamentals of Health and Physical Activity\nThis course touches upon a range of topics: cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, weight management, nutrition, disease prevention and even stress management.\n“Students will gain both knowledge and tools to maximize their health and energy, immediately and in the long term,” says instructor Leslie Barker, who teaches EXCI 251: Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity.\n“Many students comment that EXCI 251 helped them improve their own negative eating, smoking, stress and inactivity habits, while they also learned to differentiate between scientific facts and marketing hype,” adds Barker.\n \nForensic Analysis\nEveryone knows that DNA analysis revolutionized forensics, but how? If you want to find out,  Cameron Skinner , associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, suggests you take CHEM 298 AA.\n“Our approach is to first learn the underlying principles by starting with the basics such as molecules, chemical reactions and so on, before working our way towards the sophisticated tools used in a modern forensics lab,” says Skinner.\n“You will finish the course with a more realistic understanding of the field of forensics. You'll also understand the capacities and limitations of modern analysis. Some of the lessons will be case studies, some will be drawn from the textbook ... and there will be an occasional poisoning and/or murder.”\nPlease note: Skinner says he will not take responsibility for any damages or strife caused when you begin yelling at your TV during crime shows such as CSI.\n \nDiscovering Biotechnology\n“Did you enjoy The Martian?  Were you thrilled by Jurassic Park?  Did Gattaca give you pause for thought? If so, we may have a course for you,” says Paul Joyce , a professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Concordia.\nCHEM 209: Discovering Biotechnology begins with an exploration of the roles that genes and proteins play in life processes.\nIt then examines the basic principles behind the manipulation of biological molecules to produce desired changes. The course also explores the ethical ramifications of such actions.\n“Would you like to know how close we are to establishing a base on Mars? Or if we can really clone dinosaurs (or people, for that matter)? Or how close we are to the spectre of genetic discrimination?” asks Joyce. “Then register for this course.”\n \nIntroduction to Astronomy\nBlack holes, constellations, the Milky Way galaxy and beyond — PHYS 284: Introduction to Astronomy is the course for anyone interested in space.\n“Students will be introduced to advanced topics from cosmology, including the Big Bang theory, as well as the study of extra-solar planets and the search for extraterrestrial life,” says Mario D’Amico from Concordia’s Department of Physics.\nPHYS 284 will be offered as an online course this winter session. Browse through multimedia components and narrated lectures on major topics in astronomy, from the comfort of your own couch.\n“Students will have the flexibility of taking the course using their computers. They will therefore not be required to travel, or even be located in Montreal,” adds D'Amico.\n \nRegister online through the MyConcordia portal for these classes. Space is limited.\n \n"}

One way is to change the way we teach.\nThis is exactly what Catherine Calogeropoulos , a part-time instructor in Concordia's Department of Biology , is doing with her “BIOL 203 - Fundamental Nutrition” course. Her challenge? Figuring out a way to make complicated scientific concepts understandable to non-science students. Enter the professional chef.\nTo accompany each lesson, Calogeropoulos shows a video segment of a seasoned cook preparing a meal that supports the concept of the day. “The cooking reinforces the chemistry,” she explains. “It’s easier to understand how lipids work by seeing how mayonnaise is made.”\nBut the course isn’t just about understanding science fundamentals. “It's also about learning vital life skills. I want my students to come away from my course enjoying cooking and knowing how to make healthy, sustainable, inexpensive meals.”\n‘My hope is to stir interest in science’\nChanging the way we teach isn’t just about providing students with alternative ways to digest tough material; it’s also about adapting the way we approach the classroom experience.\nMario D’Amico , a part-time professor in the Department of Physics , teaches “PHYS 298 - Introduction to Astronomy,” a blended course on the foundations of the discipline.\nFor his elective, which attracts students ranging in age from 18 to 80, D’Amico finds the flexibility of the blended approach an advantage. “Attendance to the lecture portion is optional,” he explains. “So those with time or travel constraints can learn most of the course on their computers.”\nThe environment also offers flexibility in the way students can complete their work. “Using online assignments with computer-generated marks and feedback allows them the opportunity to retry questions they get wrong.” This helps those without a science background learn difficult concepts while still keeping their grades up.\nTaking D’Amico’s course is about more than just getting a passing grade to fulfill an elective. “We are at the dawn of space exploration and at the frontiers of scientific innovation,” he says. “My hope is to stir interest in science, physics and astronomy while ensuring that students enjoy a very relaxed experience.”\n \nFor more blended learning opportunities at Concordia, check out Concordia's first ever Massive Open Online Course .\n \n"}

The event will occur between about 7:12 a.m. and 2:42 p.m. EDT on May 9. | Image courtesy of NASA\nMario D’Amico is a part-time professor in Concordia’s Department of Physics , who teaches the new “PHYS 284 - Introduction to Astronomy” course.\nA planet — a wanderer in the sky as its etymology suggests — generally moves along its orbit without much adulation. However, on occasion, given rare but re-occurring conditions, it performs an acrobatic feat calling out for our attention.\nMercury, the most eccentric of wanderers, will be performing such a feat on May 9.\nLike Mercury, the messenger of the Roman gods — also the patron god of money, luck and thievery — who’s often depicted wearing winged shoes to convey his speed, Mercury the planet is swift, metallic and can be deceivingly cold.\nAt night, temperatures on Mercury can reach -173 C, despite its proximity to the Sun. It is the closest planet to the Sun, the smallest and has the fastest orbital velocity of any planet. Mercury is also known for its high orbital eccentricity (not to be confused with the word “eccentric” — although somewhat related). Eccentricity is a measure of how much a planet’s orbit deviates from a perfect circle. Mercury is the planet with the most elliptical orbital of them all.\nAnother special feature of Mercury relative to us Earthlings is that Mercury is one of two inner planets — the other is Venus. From our perspective on Earth, inner planets are interesting because they occasionally pass directly between us and the Sun, forming an eclipse of sorts referred to as a planetary transit.\nOn May 9, Mercury will pass between Earth and the Sun — or, as is stated in astronomy-speak, “Mercury will pass through inferior conjunction” with the Sun.\n \nPlanetary transits follow the same physical dynamics as a solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the moon passes between the Sun and Earth. For an eclipse or a transit to occur, two conditions must be met: the object (planet or moon) must pass between Earth and the Sun, and the object must intersect Earth’s orbital plane.\nA way to imagine these two conditions, in the case of a solar eclipse, is to think of the moon positioned between the Sun and Earth. Clearly it is not enough for the moon to be in between — it must also be high enough along its orbital inclination to obscure the Sun’s rays. This only happens a few times a year.\nIn the case of Mercury, there are only two times of the year (May and November) when Mercury’s orbital plane intersects Earth’s orbital plane. At these two times of the year, a transit could occur if, in addition to the orbits crossing, Mercury passes between Earth and the Sun — a rare event estimated at around 13 transits in 100 years.\nLike a solar eclipse, viewing planetary transits depends on the geolocation of the viewer . Another aspect of eclipses shared by transits is that viewing must be done with care. In the case of a Mercury transit, you would have to look directly at the sun. This could be harmful if not approached with caution. A technique used to avoid direct viewing is to project the image from a telescope or binoculars onto a sheet of paper .\nAs interesting as it may be, and as much as Mercury calls for your attention, if you are unable to see this year’s transit (the third Mercury transit of this century), do not despair. You will soon have another opportunity.\nMercury will continue its flight as messenger to the gods while preparing for its next performance in 2019.\nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Physics .\n \n"}

Latimer\nPERFORM Centre researcher Claudine Gauthier: \"We hope that the techniques we use in this project will be helpful to doctors in the future.\"\nIt has been a good term for Concordia's  Claudine Gauthier . \nThe assistant professor in the  Department of Physics  won the national Heart and Stroke Foundation New Investigator Award for 2015-16, as well as the foundation’s Henry J.M. Barnett Scholarship.\nThe new investigator award supports individuals who have demonstrated excellence in their pre- and postdoctoral training and wish to establish their own research laboratory.\n“I feel very lucky to have the support of Concordia and the Heart and Stroke Foundation, to be able to make exciting research happen,” says Gauthier. \nClaudine Gauthier\nGauthier has been busy developing her ideas and techniques for several years, and says she's enthusiastic for the chance to begin her research in earnest.\n\"Translational health research is very important and a key part of the Concordia and PERFORM Centre mission. I am happy I can help spearhead these efforts with my research ideas.”  \nHere, Gauthier answers some questions about her work.\nIs it unusual for a physicist to win the Heart and Stroke Foundation New Investigator Award?\nClaudine Gauthier: It’s unusual for traditional physicists, yes. But biomedical sciences are an important component of technical development in health research. Physicists are often behind the development of new technologies for measuring novel components of health, and this is the type of work I do.\nI develop new methods and combine existing technical developments to measure novel aspects of brain health. But typically, it does go more often to clinical scientists.\nTell us about your work.\nCG: I use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to develop new markers of vascular and metabolic health in the brain. These can be used to understand the impact of cardiovascular diseases on the brain, and the link between cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline and the impact of lifestyle on these interactions.\nMy work in the past has mostly been on the development of these techniques. In my application to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, I proposed to take the next step and use them to study patient populations.\nWhy is this important, now?\nCG: The World Health Organization estimates that one third of deaths in high-income countries are due to chronic vascular diseases. In these diseases, arteries throughout the body are affected and become stiffer. This effect on the arteries is thought to extend to the brain and be associated with damage to all brain cell types.\nThis damage due to stiffer arteries may be partly responsible for the cognitive decline observed in populations with vascular diseases. Because people can live for a long time with these diseases, this damage to the brain progresses over years and may significantly reduce quality of life and lead to other neurological and neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia.\nExercise can help prevent and treat these conditions, but we do not know what the biological impact of exercise on the brain is, and how it interacts with disease.\nFinding clinical strategies to improve brain health depends on our ability to measure the complex biological causes of the disease itself and of the changes that follow treatment or prevention. Non-invasive imaging strategies that capture the health of all brain cellular compartments are needed to obtain crucial information about brain health and the brain’s ability to recover from the changes that precede irreversible damage, allowing us to better design treatment strategies.\nWhat’s the overall objective?\nCG: The objective is to understand the link between cardiovascular health and disease, and brain health, at the level of both blood vessels and tissue. Because vascular lesions typically occur in the white matter (the cellular compartment that ensures rapid and efficient communication within the brain), there will be a focus on the health of this tissue compartment.\nHow does the PERFORM Centre come into play?\nCG: This project will also investigate the impact of cardiovascular and brain health on cognition. Finally, we will investigate the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., how much oxygen one can use during exercise) on brain health and cognition, to see how exercise can act to modify the effect of heart and cerebrovascular disease.\nThis fits in well with PERFORM's mission to expand our knowledge of and promote healthy lifestyles for improving population health, since my techniques can help us develop better preventative strategies.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is both a non-invasive and highly versatile tool that can be used repeatedly to obtain a variety of information about brain health. The brain health components we will study are however difficult to measure using conventional MRI techniques. Therefore, our objective is to use recent developments in MRI to devise a state-of-the-art imaging protocol to measure brain vascular and tissue health in a novel and comprehensive way.\nWhat does your work add to the field?\nCG: Because many Canadians live with heart disease for decades, the impact of this disease on other organs such as the brain becomes an integral component of heart disease itself.\nFurthermore, it is this damage to the brain, brought by an unhealthy heart and arteries, that increases the likelihood of developing a stroke. At this time, it is very difficult to measure the small damage to the brain that precedes strokes or other types of lesions, and characterizes the vulnerable area around strokes. The work we propose will contribute to the technical development necessary to measure the changes that precede and surround this irreversible damage.\nUnderstanding the changes that precede damage will allow us to better understand the disease itself, but more importantly, will allow us to devise better strategies for prevention and treatment of brain vascular lesions.\nThe program proposed includes three interrelated quantitative MRI studies. These studies will allow a comprehensive understanding of the link between cardiovascular disease and neurovascular health in its larger sense, encompassing all essential components of brain health.\nThese projects represent the most comprehensive and integrated effort to date to understand the impact of heart disease on brain health and the role of exercise in improving brain health using MRI.\nYou also won the Henry J.M. Barnett Scholarship, one of two possible supplementary prizes awarded to a highly rated national new investigator working in stroke or a related field. Did you win that award on the basis of the same work described above?\nCG: Yes. My work spans the entire spectrum from healthy older adults to older adults with cardiovascular risk factors and those with overt cardiovascular disease and stroke. The prize is awarded partly for my work on strokes.\nIn this part of my program, I look at the changes in brain metabolism associated with the stroke and following the course of recovery during the first week after the stroke. This is important because we think metabolism around the stroke is important in determining if that part of the brain will survive over the long term.\nBut measuring this using existing techniques is very difficult, so this information cannot typically be used to make an informed diagnosis and treatment decisions. We hope that the techniques we use in this project will be helpful to doctors in the future.

The acceleration of gravity on the moon is 1.67 m/s2. Determine the time it takes for the feather to fall to the surface of the moon.\nIf this physics problem makes you break out in a cold sweat, you are not alone. And yet thousands of students enroll yearly in university classes to undertake the daunting task of solving questions far more complex than that.\nMany of them have difficulty overcoming their physics-induced anxiety.\nOne Concordia researcher has a solution: flip the traditional classroom on its head.\nIn a paper recently published in the journal Physical Review, Calvin Kalman , a professor in the Department of Physics , and his research team undertook a five-year study involving close to 1,000 students enrolled in four physics courses at two universities.\nUsing data gathered during student interviews, writing assessments and a special questionnaire, the researchers found that students can actually improve their thinking and learning by engaging in “Reflective Writing” and interactive activities.\n“It has been shown that in typical physics classes, students’ beliefs about their own learning deteriorate or at best stay the same. I want to reverse that result,” says Kalman, who is also the principal of Concordia’s Science College .\n“This study shows that if you combine a meta-cognitive activity with an interactive activity, students can better hone their thinking abilities for that course.”\nMeta-what?\nSimply put, meta-cognition is thinking about your thinking.\n“When students engage in 'Reflective Writing,' which is a meta-cognitive activity, they express in their own words what the concepts found in the textbook mean, how they connect to concepts in other chapters and how they connect to personal life experience,” Kalman says.\n“That’s far more involved than a simple cognitive exercise like summary writing, where you just write a précis of the ideas in the textbook, using the same vocabulary,”\nThe importance of collaboration\nKalman’s study shows that students really see rewards when they follow “Reflective Writing” with a collaborative activity like working with their peers and professors in the lab.\n“That combination of activities produces what is referred to as cognitive dissonance — that feeling of discomfort when the new information you’re confronted with conflicts with what you already believe,” Kalman says.\nWhen students first grapple with a problem on their own, they may come to the wrong conclusion. Finding out the real solution in a collaborative setting helps improve their understanding, as well as their approach to learning.\nFlipping the classroom on its head\n“I want instructors to move away from relying solely on the traditional lecture method,” says Kalman.\n“Instead, I envision what is called a ‘flipped classroom,’ where students try to understand concepts before coming to class, and then have an opportunity to explore these concepts in the class alongside their peers, and with the guidance of a teacher.”\n \nPartners in research: This study was made possible in part by funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. It was co-authored by Calvin S. Kalman, Concordia University; Mandana Sobhanzadeh, Mount Royal University; Robert Thompson, University of Calgary; Ahmed Ibrahim, University of California, Riverside; and Xihui Wang, McGill University.\n"}

You could say it’s Trivial-Pursuit based.”\nFrom the recent blood moon to studies of water on Mars, talk of space is all over the media. “It’s an exciting time for the field,” says D’Amico, noting modern scientific developments have taken exploration to a whole new level.\nHe points out that technology related to propulsion is improving rapidly. “We are developing satellites and also artificial intelligence, so we are going to have great robots going up as well … Machines will be able to do more and to survive longer out in space, so these are exciting times. It’s the beginning of this new frontier of the stars.”\nD’Amico’s love of astronomy goes back to his childhood. “When I was a young boy, I wanted a telescope and obviously I couldn’t afford one,” he recalls. He bought a used manual for a quarter and attempted to make his own lense. “I found out that it was almost impossible!” D’Amico eventually learned how to build telescopes with very inexpensive, ready-made lenses.\nD’Amico remains fascinated with the solar system, and was happy when former physics department chair Truong Vo-Van suggested the course.\nThe dazzling depictions of space we see in movies like Gravity, Interstellar, and The Martian may not be so far away, he says. “We expect that the planets out there will be home for a lot of us, perhaps within a hundred years.”\nThe course will eventually be online only, but for its first semester it will feature a mix of lectures and online content, and address current events involving the heavens.\nEven if most of his students don’t end up becoming astrophysicists, D’Amico says this course can teach them a lot. “My ultimate hope is they will become more passionate about the stars.”\nStudents can register online through the MyConcordia portal for January’s PHYS 298 - Introduction to Astronomy course now.

The stigma can start in school and continue into high school, depending on their teachers’ enthusiasm and their access to resources. That’s why Concordia is involved in several initiatives to dispel this myth by teaching and promoting science to youths through events like summer camps, fairs and tours of Concordia’s labs. The goal is to create an interest in the field, not only for those on a scientific career path, but for any curious student.\nThis fall, Concordia held two events committed to the interactive promotion of science: the Science Summit, held on October 24, and Exposcience, which occurred on November 1-2.\nScience Summit\nThe Science Summit is a new initiative that brought CEGEP students and their teachers to Concordia, where they had the chance to discover what it’s like to research in Concordia’s science labs. They also had the opportunity to conduct guided experiments.\n“For the Science Summit, science should be read broadly, in that we’re looking to provide opportunities in pure and applied, as well as social sciences and other disciplines,” says Bradley Tucker, vice-president of Registrarial Service.\nDue to growing interest from the CEGEP level, the Science Summit is now looking to expand into placements where college students from the Montreal area could gain experience in Concordia’s labs.\n“The initiative aims to introduce college students to Concordia’s state-of-the-art facilities. When it comes time for them to choose a university, they’ll be aware of everything we have to offer,” says Tucker.\nExposcience\nCelebrating its 31st anniversary in November of this year, Exposcience successfully brought together Concordia science students volunteers, young children and their parents. The exhibits and activities are designed to instil in the children an early interest in science and technology. Exposcience also gives Concordia students the chance to positively influence young people while showcasing what they’re learning.\nBehind the event are Miriam Posner and Cameron Tilson, who have both been involved in Exposcience for more than 30 years. They share a passion for teaching kids about science and say the positive feedback they receive is highly rewarding.\n“It makes me proud to be a Concordian,” says Tilson, the assistant director for Institutional Planning. “And it takes me back to my own academic roots in the sciences as a Concordia graduate.”\nTilson shared the story of a Concordia engineering graduate, now in a successful career in aerospace, who remembered coming to Exposcience in the early 1990s. He believes the event played a large part in both his choice of career and university.\nPosner added that Exposcience is family-oriented and that children and their parents engage in learning with Concordia’s student volunteers.\n“One can’t help but be energized by the enthusiasm of our students,” says Posner, the technical supervisor for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, “and by the expressions of fascination in the faces of children as they begin to take in and understand science and technology and see that it can be fun!”\n"}

But while incentive to study is strong, as of 2011, only 18.6 per cent of university graduates aged 25 to 64 had earned their highest degree, certificate or diploma in the subject.\nConcordia is aiming to help boost those numbers. This summer, it’s piquing elementary-school-aged children’s interest in science with two interactive outreach initiatives.\n \nAha moments at the Eureka! Festival\nThe first — the Eureka! Festival — takes place at the Montreal Science Centre, in Montreal’s Old Port, from June 13 to 15.\nAt the three-day event hosted by the Science Centre and the Conférence régionale des élus de Montréal, Concordia students, staff and faculty are hosting a range of workshops out of three tent-kiosks.\nConcordia engineering students have built a number of K’NEX structures, including replicas of the Eiffel Tower, Habitat 67 and a space shuttle. Photo by Concordia University\nThe subject matter ranges from physics and chemistry to engineering, but visitors won’t be treated to any conventional classroom lectures.\n“Science is cool,” says Miriam Posner, technical supervisor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. “We want to get kids interested in it at a very young age.”\nTo that end, Posner herself is introducing visitors to printing and paper-making in the Physics and Chemistry tent. “We’ll be using recycled fibers, and the kids will get to make actual paper.”\nA team from  Concordia’s chapter of the educational outreach organisation Let’s Talk Science  is sharing a tent with Virtual Touch, which will showcase the  Illimitable Space System , a digital technology that animates human bodies in real time. The system was developed by Miao Song and Serguei Mokhov, affiliate assistant professors and part-time faculty members in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.\nMeanwhile, at the Concordia-staffed K’NEX Labyrinth, children will be able to navigate a maze made from the popular K’NEX toy.\nIn all, some 30 university ambassadors will be on hand to show children — many of whom will be bused in by their schools on the Friday — what science is all about.\n“Audiences can ask questions and interact with the faculty, the staff and the students. They’ll be able to engage in scientific discussion at a level that we hope will encourage them to explore the subject matter further.”\nThe return of Westmount Science Camp\nMany of the same Concordians — including Song and Mokhov, as well as the gang from Let’s Talk Science — are also leading workshops for six- to 13-year-olds at the Westmount Science Camp in July and August.\nThe campers, who spend most of the time at Westmount High School, will take part in three field trips to the Loyola Campus.\n“We’re going to be designing all sorts of hands-on experiments for them to watch and participate in,” Posner says. “The idea is to give the campers an interactive approach to learning about basic scientific concepts.”\n \nFormer astronaut Marc Garneau paid a visit to the 2013 Westmount Science Camp. | Photo by Concordia University\nThis marks the second consecutive year that Concordia has participated in Westmount Science Camp. Faculty, students and staff from the Faculty of Arts and Science, the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and the John Molson School of Business will all play a part in the activities.\nFor the students who lead the experiments, the experience can be a valuable one — especially if they aspire to careers as educators.\n“They’re there to spur childrens’ interest in science and technology,” Posner says. “They’re there to show them that science is fun and interesting.”\nThe  Eureka! Festival  takes place from June 13 to 15 at the Montreal Science Centre, in the city’s Old Port. The Westmount Science Camp runs from July 7 to August 15.\n"}

Since its inception 30 years ago, the university’s Institute for Co-operative Education has allowed students to take the knowledge and skills they acquire, and apply them in the workplace — an experience designed to give them an edge in both their career and education.\nNow 24 more students from the Faculty of Arts and Science, mainly in their second year, will be able to take advantage of four new Co-op programs in anthropology, sociology, journalism and political science. The work terms are set to begin as early as May 2014.\n“One of our mandates is to increase the depth and breadth of experiential learning opportunities for students,” says Gerry Hughes, director of the Institute for Co-operative Education.\nHe points to the new programs, as well as the three new professional experience options in physics, computation arts and design, as examples of how the university is supporting students by offering new ways to learn — and to put what they’ve learned into practice. An added benefit, Hughes says, is that Co-op students also become more engaged with the community.\nThe Faculty of Arts and Science was a pioneer in co-operative education when it introduced work-study programs in chemistry and biochemistry more than 30 years ago. Today, all of Concordia’s faculties offer experiential learning programs that see students alternate between academic and work terms throughout the school year.\nHughes is proud of the training Co-op participants receive. “They are determined and talented, and offer employers brand-new knowledge and a willingness to learn in the workplace, four productive months at a time,” he says.\nThe decision to introduce programs in the four new disciplines was informed by studies of other universities — including the University of Waterloo, the University of Victoria and the University of Toronto — with similar offerings, all of which demonstrated measurable success.\nResearch was also conducted to gauge interest from employers in Quebec and across Canada. In fact, Concordia was receiving requests for students in these areas even before the new programs were approved last November.\nAn exceptional pool of student talent\nJane Fairhurst, Co-op coordinator for the Faculty of Arts and Science, expects potential employers to be impressed by the students’ skills and enthusiasm.\n“We have a lot of students interested in sustainability and social justice, as well as government, foreign affairs and international relations,” she says.\nTo be accepted to the Co-op program, applicants must meet a minimum GPA requirement, submit a letter of intent and take part in a group interview.\nAccording to business development coordinator Lucia Plescia, the 24 new participants will arrive with an impressive skill set. “Our students are able to perform socio-economic and market research,” she says. “They are also skilled in communication, and they understand human behaviour and the importance of conflict resolution and dialogue in negotiation strategies.”\nAnd often, their abilities go even further: “Many are trained in sustainability. Some have specialized geographic training and a socio-political understanding of specific regions.”\nThese facts are not lost on employers. Among those interested in Concordia students for the May 2014 work term are Environment Canada and the Treasury Board of Canada (Ottawa, Ont.); the International Air Transport Association and the Quebec-Labrador Foundation (Montreal, Que.); the Green Timbers Heritage Society Environmental Outreach Team (Surrey, B.C.); Husky Energy (Calgary, Alta.); and BC Hydro (Vancouver, B.C.). Journalism students will be able to take advantage of opportunities at the CBC and Concordia’s University Communications Services office.\nWhile recruitment for many of these positions will come through the Co-op program, students are expected to search for work as well.\n“Co-op is not a placement agency, but we are here to support students,” says Fairhurst. “They’re not left on their own.”\nIf you’re an employer looking for a student to hire, or a student interested in applying to the Co-op program, email the Institute for Co-operative Education at coopinstitute@concordia.ca .\nRead more about student success at the Institute for Co-operative Education.\nThe National Co-operative Education Week runs from March 17 to 21.

Nanotechnology’s applications are far-reaching: nanoparticles, which are a fraction of the width of a human hair, can help paint last longer, make cement dry faster, reinforce lightweight construction materials and get light-collecting solar cells to produce more electricity.\nNanotechnology’s applications are far-reaching.\nQuebec’s Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport (now known as the Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche, de la Science et de la Technologie) recently granted the three schools $299,500 to implement the joint project, titled Transfert d’expertise et initiation à la recherche universitaire dans l’enseignement de la nanotechnologie et des sciences associées au collégial.\nThe funds will be split between the three schools and will enable Collège Ahuntsic students to have structured physics labs at Concordia and École Polytechnique. Some of them will be paired up with undergraduate and graduate students to conduct experiments, for which they will receive course credit. Concordia students will gain valuable mentoring experience by working with the Cegep students.\nPhysics professor and department Chair Truong Vo-Van is coordinating Concordia’s part of the project, and says the goal is to train the Cegep students through hands-on, structured research projects.\n“Instead of having a conventional approach to teaching, we’d like to introduce them to the various tools used in nanotechnology research, and expose them to different aspects of the research conducted at our two universities,” says Vo-Van.\n“We want them to look at the whole picture of nanotechnology and, in particular, the objectives of our research projects, in terms of applications. At Concordia, for example, we’re interested in nanoparticles. We study their basic properties with respect to interaction with light or with different electromagnetic waves and related things like that, because we’re interested in curiosity-driven research. At the same time, we also look at the different applications. We can use nanoparticles to increase, for example, the efficiency of solar cells, which transform light into electricity, and to design new biosensing devices.”\nThe project is also supported by Technologies Nanomundi, a Quebec nanotech company, and NanoQuébec, a non-profit organization that fosters nanotechnology innovation related to sustainable economic growth in Quebec.\n“They’re supporting our project in terms of logistics: they’re organizing student visits to industry for us, because they have a large industrial and institutional network,” explains Vo-Van, who also hopes this project will forge better relationships and cooperation between Concordia and francophone Cegeps.\nRelated links:\n"}

Science 101 courses can make or break a student’s decision to venture into scientific fields.\n“The language, fundamentals and scope of science gateway courses can be akin to a foreign culture,” says Calvin Kalman, principal of Concordia’s Science College and a professor in the Department of Physics. “Students can have great difficulty reading scientific texts — even when they are written in their native language — while also coping with complex knowledge taught by their professor.”\nSince 1995, Kalman has investigated new ways to ease this learning curve. It was his late wife, Concordia English professor Judith Kalman, who made a suggestion that led to his current research and the studies they co-authored.\n“The main problem in scientific teaching is that its approach is not holistic,” he explains, noting that high school through university-level textbooks aren’t necessarily consistent and don’t employ user-friendly language. “They offer layers of scientific results, coming from competing interpretations, deposited during centuries.”\nKalman’s most recent paper, published in the journal Science & Education, followed 15 college and university students over the course of a semester. He asked that they practise what he calls “reflective writing” — a process where students digest and analyze assigned readings before classroom discussions and pen their thoughts. “It’s a way of getting students to wrestle with, rather than to summarize, materials,” he says.\nStudents were interviewed three times and asked to describe how reflective writing helped their comprehension of course content. “They felt that they had to put the information into their own words, which really helped them to understand and refine key concepts,” Kalman says. “Reflective writing gets students to initiate a self-dialogue about texts and ask: ‘What do I understand?’ and ‘What do I not understand?’”\nKalman says teaching and learning is most successful when student concepts overlap with their professor’s. “Students are often looking for basics to pass courses, but that doesn’t engage them,” he says. “Unless they come to class prepared to ask questions, students end up serving time.”\nKalman’s solutions aren’t radical. He encourages professors to go beyond PowerPoint presentations and lectures to promote critical thinking among students. Because his research could have implications for other fields, he recently obtained a three-year grant of $139,600 from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.\nThe funding has allowed him to launch collaborations. He is the principal investigator in studies in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, as well as internationally with peers in Portugal, China and Vietnam. Following a course he delivered at Tra Vinh University last fall, he was asked to supervise a PhD student from Vietnam who will incorporate Kalman’s best teaching practices in his own country. He has similar arrangements with students from China and Egypt.\nImproving science education, Kalman says, is the only way that Canada can remain at the forefront of the knowledge-based economy: “If students don’t understand what they’re learning they’ll drop out and we’ll lose ideas as well as people who will move our country forward. What this country needs are people who think critically — who are entrepreneurs — and that begins with how they’re taught.”\nRelated links:\n"}
{"url": "http://faculty.concordia.ca/glamoure/", "field": "artsci_physics", "title": "Lamoureux Lab: Research", "text": "Intranet\nWelcome to the webpage of the laboratory of Guillaume   Lamoureux. Research in the lab is focused on applying theoretical   and computational methods to fundamental problems in chemistry and   biology.\nWe are interested in enzyme catalysis, membrane transport, and   molecular recognition. Understanding these processes — and how   they can be inhibited or enhanced — is at the core of many   pressing issues in biology and medicine.\nOur research is at the confluence of physical chemistry,   theoretical chemistry, and theoretical biophysics. It relies on a   solid understanding of molecular interactions and on a wide array of   methods in modeling and in statistical mechanics. It makes extensive   use of computers. The laboratory has access to computational   resources from the Centre for Research in Molecular Modeling   ( CERMM )   and from Calcul Québec and Compute Canada .\nSome active research projects in the laboratory:\nProtein-protein interactions\nProteins often acquire their biological activity by associating   with one another and forming larger functional units. Finding out   which two proteins are likely to interact is a difficult problem,   since humans have around 20,000 protein-coding genes — creating a very large number of pairs of potential interaction   partners. Moreover, this large network of interactions can be   affected by mutations such as those occurring in cancer.\nWe are developing fast computer algorithms to predict   residue-residue contacts and protein-protein interactions and to   infer which mutations are likely to perturb these interactions (and   affect biological function). We are taking advantage of a number of   recent developments in a field of computer science called deep   learning. Deep learning technologies are commonly used for   automatic translation and for voice or image recognition. Treating   the interaction of two proteins as a form of recognition — molecular   recognition —, we are developing deep learning algorithms trained to   predict the likelihood of any two proteins interacting.\nMetalloproteins\nThis theme of research is related to computational enzymology,   which is the study of enzymes and enzymatic reactions using   molecular modeling and computer simulations. Computational   enzymology aims primarily at describing the structure and relative   energy of the short-lived states along an enzymatic reaction and at   connecting them into an atomically-detailed kinetic picture. Because   these short-lived states are usually not accessible through   experimental techniques, it can provide new levels of insight to   otherwise well-characterized reactions, and new interpretations to   poorly-understood reactions.\nWe are developing methods for computational enzymology and   applying them to enzymes containing metal atoms at their active   sites (zinc, magnesium, manganese, etc.). Although about half of all   known proteins contain at least one metal atom, no method is   currently available to efficiently and reliably simulate chemical   reactions in metalloenzymes. We are focusing on zinc hydrolases,   which are involved in numerous biological functions such as blood   pressure regulation, digestion, intra-ocular pressure regulation,   and bacterial resistance to antibiotics.\nOur research objectives are the following:\nDevelop methods for computational enzymology that are accurate     enough to analyze the energetics of steps along enzymatic     reactions, yet efficient enough to observe the catalytic effects     of large-scale protein motion occurring on the nanosecond     time-scale.\nUncover new structure-function relationships in enzymes. In     particular, we want to get a better understanding of the effects     of metal and ligand substitution in metalloenzymes, of the effects     of ligand binding on the motion of enzymes, and of the catalytic     role of residues separated from the reaction site.\nEnable new computational strategies for enzyme inhibitor     design.\nAmmonium transporters\nAlthough lipid membranes are relatively permeable to ammonia,   bacteria, yeast, and plants under too low ammonium concentrations   express transmembrane proteins from the Amt/MEP family that have a   high affinity for ammonium and facilitate its transport across the   membrane. In mammals, a similar function is performed by the   analogous Rhesus (Rh) proteins, present in red blood cells, liver   cells, and kidney cells.\nThe first x-ray structures of proteins from the Amt/MEP/Rh family   have been obtained only very recently, for the bacterial ammonium   channel AmtB and for the archaeal channel Amt-1. Although these   structures provide a lot of insight into the general mechanism of   Amt proteins, no conclusion has been reached on the nature of the   permeant species. Depending on the specific Amt protein (in bacteria   or in plants), experiments suggest a net transport of either   NH3 or NH4+.\nThe nature of the permeant species is even more uncertain in Rh   proteins. Some experiments indicate that they facilitate ammonia   transport across membranes, but some others suggest that they are in   fact carbon dioxide (CO2) channels. Phylogenetic studies   of the Rh family imply that Rh proteins may indeed have evolved a   function distinct from that of the Amt/MEP family. Given how   chemically different NH3 and CO2 are, the   notion that homologs of ammonia transporters can function as carbon   dioxide channels is intriguing.\nWe are interested in answering the following questions:\nWhat chemical species are allowed in and out of the pore of AmtB?\nWhat are the important interactions along the permation pathway?\nIs AmtB an ammonia channel or an ammonium transporter?\nAre Rh proteins carbon dioxide channels as it was suggested?\nExternal funding\n"}

Returning to Quebec was a homecoming; he grew up in Trois-Rivières and did his undergraduate work at McGill (1999) before undertaking PhD (2005) research at Cornell. He was drawn to Concordia because of the small size of the Physics Department, and excited by the potential to contribute significantly to shaping its future.\nThe CFI grant is crucial to Champagne's work. It will be used to purchase an Ultra-low Temperature Cryogen-free Cryostat for his research group's work on quantum nanoelectronics. As he points out, the apparatus is both literally and figuratively cool. By producing environments that are only 0.3 degrees above absolute zero (about 1000 times colder than ice), \"It now allows us to do the science we want to do, and puts us on par with much bigger research groups.\"\nQuantum nanoelectronics focuses on discovering the properties of the extremely small. Champagne and the members of his research team are interested in examining the group dynamics between electrons at the quantum level because this is \"where the real rules of the universe are hidden.\"\nUnfortunately, they are not easy to uncover.\nImagine trying to determine the inner workings of a Ferrari engine while it speeds around a Formula 1 track. This is the situation Champagne faces in examining electrons under normal conditions. Even temperatures that would have our teeth chattering are much too hot for his purposes. For him, heat is noise that masks the fundamental way in which basic units of matter interact. The Cryostat will help him slow atoms and electrons down considerably, to unveil interactions that lead to exotic new states of matter.\nThe competitive advantage of the machine lies in its construction. Unlike other devices which produce extremely cold temperatures, the new Cryostat will have a closed cooling system; Champagne and his research team will not have to keep topping it up with liquid Helium which - at $10 per litre - can become a grant-eating expense of the order of $50 000 per year. \"Once our machine is in place, we will only be spending money on research,\" not supplies, explains Champagne.\nThe primary test vehicle in his lab is a relatively new material, graphene. It consists entirely of carbon in a chicken-wire-like lattice only one-atom thick.  As such, it is truly two-dimensional with a huge surface area to weight ratio. With the PCYIAP support, Champagne's team will try to establish that the material can be used as both a storage device and sensor.\nFor instance, graphene can safely store huge amounts of hydrogen. However, as Champagne points out, \"The trick is to show that graphene can also release it on command, and this we cannot do yet\". He is examining how stressing the graphene by stretching will reduce the carbon-hydrogen binding energy and release the gas.\nWhile the research is very fundamental, it may one day provide an answer to our attempts to provide infrastructure for hydrogen-based vehicles. Right now however Champagne says, \"We are only looking to develop proof of concept devices. Once we show something is possible, it becomes an engineering problem, not a science one.\"\nThe Ultra-low Temperature Cryogen-free Cryostat will be custom made to Champagne's specifications. As such, he expects delivery in the spring of 2011. With a total price tag of almost $457 000, the device is also being supported by a CFI-matching grant from the Ministère de l'Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport du Québec, with the balance being supported by other partners.\n"}
