The deadline for applications is January 25.\nAbout Brenda Carter and David Wheeler\nBrenda Carter (1937-1989)\nBrenda Carter was born in Battersea, a borough of London, England, on June 24, 1937. At the age of eleven, she won a scholarship to Grey Coat School, Westminster, and from there went to Salisbury Training College where she studied to become an elementary school teacher. She taught first at a school in the Scilly Islands, then moved to successively more responsible positions in schools in the County of Surrey. In 1972 she was appointed head teacher of Duppas Junior School in the Borough of Croydon, a low-achieving school situated in socially mixed area. By the time she resigned from this position for reasons of health in 1984, the standards of work by the children at the school in academic subjects, sports, arts and music, had risen to above average levels.\nIn 1984 Brenda Carter married and moved to Canada. Unable to teach for physical reasons, she enrolled in a master's program in the history of education at McGill University. At the time of her death on April 12, 1989, she had just embarked on writing up a study of one-room schoolhouses in the province of Québec at the beginning of this century.\nWithout formal mathematical qualifications, Brenda had a strong intuitive grasp of mathematical processes and procedures, and while not a doctrinaire feminist, she very much wanted many more women to find the keen pleasure in mathematics that she had found in it. The Memorial Scholarship was established by her husband, David Wheeler, a Professor of Mathematics at Concordia University from 1975 to 1990, and funded by the generous donations of friends and colleagues.\nDavid Wheeler (1925-2000)\nDavid Wheeler was born in UK on February 16, 1925. Through a career extending over 50 years and spent in three different countries (UK, USA, Canada), David Wheeler has made many important contributions to mathematical education at large. He was a professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in Concordia University, where he taught mathematics and mathematics education courses. He was the founder and long time editor of the journal, For the Learning of Mathematics, one of the renown international journals in mathematics education.\nDavid Wheeler died in Vancouver on October 7th, 2000. One of his colleagues, Mogens Niss, paid a tribute to him in these words: \"David Wheeler was a mathematics educator who never in a fraction of a moment forgot that, from his perspective, mathematics education ought to be provided to human beings, in order to serve their needs as human beings, and with due respect being paid to how human beings are different, and to how they live, feel and think. Hence empathy, open- and broadmindedness, an unpompous sense of reality, and not the least silent humour, should permeate the way we deal with mathematics education. All of these permeated David himself. We have indeed lost a giant in mathematics education, and some of us a dear friend as well.\"\nNick Herscovics Scholarship\nThe Nick Herscovics Scholarship is awarded to a student pursuing full-time studies in the M.T.M. program. The amount of the scholarship is $1,000 and it is awarded based on academic excellence. The award can be held by the same person for a maximum of two years. The selection of the recipient is made by the Director of the M.T.M program in consultation with other members of the Department.\nApplication forms for the award are available from, and are to be submitted to, the departmental Graduate Program Assistant. The deadline for receipt of applications is October 31.\nBack to top\n"}

He is survived by his wife Fauzia Begum, their son Syed Furrokh-Nabeel Ali (Samira Karim), and grandson Syed Aydin Karim Ali.\nTwareque completed his doctoral studies in mathematical physics at the University of Rochester in1973.  After periods of research and teaching in ICTP Trieste, University of Toronto, UPEI, and ITP Clausthal, Germany, he joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Concordia University in 1981.  He was promoted to full professor here in 1990.\nTwareque pursued research in many areas of mathematics, mostly in analysis, functional analysis, and quantum mechanics.  He published his work with numerous scientists around the world in over 120 research articles and in a number of books. He was always studying and preparing lectures, now wavelets, now differential geometry, now group theory. His presentations were structured, lucid, interesting, deep, and, before the fashion of electronic displays, by means of perfectly clear handwriting on the blackboard. \nHe was not inclined to profess an overt teaching philosophy but an observer might infer that it was ‘empowerment through mathematical understanding’.  He was himself impressively erudite with an eclectic taste that included history, philosophy and literature, and the mastery of at least five European languages in addition to Bengali and Hindi, and some Farsi and Arabic.\nHe was extremely generous and engendered enormous affection in his students and colleagues. He had an amusing story or anecdote for almost every occasion – often related to other mathematicians he knew from his extensive travels – and had a repertoire of funny jokes that naturally prompted his distinctive laughter.\nHis inspiring presence and cheerful demeanor will be sorely missed by us all.\nTestimonials can be sent  here  for publication.\nMarch 17, 2016\nWith deep sorrow, I learned about the passing of Dr. Ali.\nTwareque was a very well known scientist, with important contributions in the field of Mathematics and Physics, but even more important he was an exceptional human being.\nI first met him in Havana, Cuba in the nineties. Had the honour to organize, jointly with him, the first workshop in Wavelets and Quantization Methods at the University of Havana. Thanks to his remarkable persistence, the event went on for almost two decades and left a fingerprint in the scientific community, not only in Cuba but in a wider Latin American context.    His leadership allowed for a durable and fruitful relationship between both Math departments at Concordia and Havana universities , along all these years.\nHe fell in love with the city of Havana and its people, and was consequent with this feeling over his entire life. There, he left behind numerous friends and colleagues, well aware of his limitless generosity, sense of solidarity and contagious laugh.\nPablo Olivares\nAssociate Professor, Department of Mathematics\nRyerson University\nFebruary 18, 2016\nThere is nothing not to like about Professor Ali.\nI first met him in Malaysia, during his first visit as an invited speaker to our Expository Quantum Lecture Series in 2007 (EQuaLS1) with the theme of Geometry, Number Theory and Quantum Physics 2007. He for sure was among the expert in the field of quantization theory. The event was organized by INSPEM, University Putra Malaysia. During his visit, I approached him discussing whether I can further my Ph.D under his supervision. He agreed and through his help and justification mentioning Montreal is among the best place to study mathematical physics, I managed to get a government scholarship starting early September 2008.\nDays in Montreal have never been so difficult for us. Despite being an expert in his field, he was so humble in nature. He has been very helpful with almost everything since the early day we arrived. His friends are all over and through him, my other half has had this opportunity to make contacts with the engineering department of Concordia and until now remain in good relationship. Our almost five years in Montreal have been so fruitful. Thanks to him.\nAfter I finished in 2014, we remained to be in good contacts and he has supported our EQuaLS series continuously. Therefore, his recent visit to Malaysia (EQuaLS8) was the most unforgettable memory since it didn't occur to me that it was going to be his last visit. He has contributed much to our institute, INSPEM through his ideas, suggestions and a lot more. Most of us here in Malaysia will never forget Prof. Ali and he has become part of our big 'family' here in the institute. Professor Ali will definitely be missed.\nMy deepest condolences, to his wife and family.\nNurisya Mohd Shah\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Physics\nUniversity Putra Malaysia\nFebruary 8, 2016\nI was postdoctoral fellow at CRM on October 1999.  I think it must have been early November, and an elegant sir apparently of Indian origin (I did not know at the time he was from Bangladesh) knocked at the ajar door of my office and introduced himself to me in Italian, with the typical regional accent of Trieste.\nThat was a surreal moment!\nOver the past 16 years he has been a continuous presence in personal and professional life; his then PhD student Anna, became my wife and Twareque was present at my wedding in Poland (and he danced too!)\nHis office is just two doors down the corridor: his endearing laughter still echoes in my ear when I sit in my office. His wide interests and education made his company fantastically pleasant and never obtrusive.\nI have very fond memories of Twareque, in particular those associated to the conferences we attended together, several times, in Bialowieza and Havana.\nHis untimely passing leaves all of us disconcerted.\nMy wife Anna, my Parents Daria and Pino and myself are deeply saddened by his passing and wish to extend our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel and his family.  \nMarco Bertola\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 3, 2016\nI knew Twareque since he began his career at Concordia.  He was special and unique in so many ways.  Academically, he was very well established as an expert in mathematical physics and had professional contacts literally in every corner of the world.  I don’t know anyone else who traveled as extensively as he did to give invited talks, or to participate in conferences, or official exchange programs between Concordia and other universities that were created through his initiative, such as the annual one between Concordia and the University of Havana and another one with the University of Bialystok, Poland.\nTwareque was one of the most broadly educated people I have known.  Besides his own areas of expertise in mathematical physics, he was familiar with philosophy, history, literature and poetry. He spoke six or seven languages, and was quite at home in most of the countries he visited. \nHe was an excellent teacher who also taught in the Science College from time to time and the students there greatly appreciated the way he introduced them to genuine mathematical thinking.  He had a terrific sense of humour and an endless supply of stories and anecdotes.  I chatted with him over a cup of coffee just a few days before he left for Malaysia and feel a very profound sense of loss.  We will all miss his stories, his laughter, his wisdom and his expertise.\nHal Proppe\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 2, 2016\nTwareque is one of the most outstanding men I have known. A man of great culture and modesty.\nI am friends with Twareque since 1998. I had the chance to meet him thanks to one of the many academic responsibilities he had, both within and outside the university, such as member of the Graduate Committee of the Mathematics and Statistics Department at Concordia University, 1999-2002; member of a special committee appointed by the Dean to study the future of the Department of Physics and that recommended measures to restructure it, 2000-2001; he was a member of the Organizing Committee of the XI to the XXVI Colloquia on Geometric Methods in Physics, developed in Bialowieza, Poland, from 1992 to 2007; Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of Montreal, 2003-2006; member of the Organizing Committee and founder of I to XVIII Workshops held in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Havana; he helped the development of international scientific cooperation between the University of Havana, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Center for International Academic Cooperation at Concordia University. In particular, Twareque's contribution to the scientific development of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer at University of Havana was outstanding, since 1998 when he began collaborating with the Faculty, encouraging the participation of its members in research and in the development of the research on Wavelets and its various applications, including in Physics.\nAnother of Twareque's contributions was the organization of an annual workshop of international importance to promote the participation of - and exchange with - young faculty members, which gave much added vitality to the event. Twareque showed a great capacity to help the University of Havana and in particular, the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, by donations of computer equipment for the Faculty and through his efforts in bringing international experts to exchange experiences with the Cuban mathematical community and to deliver specialized courses. In 2009, in recognition for his service and efforts, the University of Havana awarded Twareque the special title of Invited Professor.\nHe was a man of extreme human sensitivity. Special friend of my family. We regret the loss of a great friend and a great man of science. I wish to express my condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel.\nReinaldo Rodriguez\n"}

Students are invited to attend these sessions by email.\nIf you missed the orientation/advising session, you are encouraged to see  the academic advisor  of their program of study prior to registering for any course. You should bring your letter of admission.\nReturning students in a Mathematics & Statistics program are encouraged to see the academic advisor  of their program of study every year prior to registration. Students can also see an academic advisor throughout the year, as needed.\n \nMost frequent academic advising questions & answers\n \nWhat can I do if I can't register because the course is full?\nThe SIS system has a waiting list feature that has discontinued the practice of requesting course overfills through our Department. If the course you want to register for is full, the SIS system will automatically ask you if you want to be on a waiting list, and if you agree, it will tell you what number you are on the list.  You will then be informed by email when space becomes available and you will automatically be registered in the course.\nPlease note that the Department cannot add you to the waiting list, nor can it change your place on the list. Enrollment capacities for each section have been increased and normally reflect the number of seats in the classroom.  Overfilling a classroom size is not permitted as it is against University fire regulations.\nHow can I add or remove exemptions?\nExemptions are different from prerequisite waivers. An exemption is granted to a student upon admission if the student took and passed a course required in their program with more than D+ in CEGEP or equivalent studies. Changes in exemptions are exceptional and students need to have compelling reasons.\nAdding exemptions\nIf you realize that you were not given an exemption for a course that should have been included, you can request to add an exemption, as follows:\nMathematics & Statistics program students must submit a student request form with supporting documents to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in LB 901-2.  The request is then given to our Undergraduate Program Director for his recommendation and sent to the Faculty for their approval.  The student will receive a revised admissions letter should it be approved, or will be informed if not.\nStudents in other programs must contact their home department to find out the procedures even if it is to add an exemption for one of our courses.\nIndependent students must contact the independent student advisor to find out the procedures.\nPlease ensure that the student request form is filled properly, otherwise it will cause unecessary delays that may result in the request not being approved. The student request should include a valid reason, a current copy of your student record, and supporting documentation validating request.\nRemoving exemptions\nIf an exemption was granted to you but you did not receive a grade that is required in some programs, you may request to have an exemption removed so that you can take the course again and get a better grade. \nYou can request to remove an exemption as follows:\nMathematics & Statistics program students must submit a student request form with supporting documents to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in LB 901-2; a strong case must be made.  The request is then given to the Undergraduate Program Director for his recommendation and sent to the Faculty for their approval.  The student will receive a revised admissions letter should it be approved, or will be informed if not.\nStudents in other programs must contact their home department to find out the procedures even if it is to remove an exemption for one of our courses.\nIndependent students must contact the independent student advisor to find out the procedures.\nPlease ensure that the student request form is filled properly, otherwise it will cause unecessary delays that may result in the request not being approved. The student request should include a valid reason, a current copy of your student record, and supporting documentation validating request.\nWhat are the procedures for a late DNE or DISC?\nLate DNE or DISC requests are done through a Student Request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form (found on your MyConcordia Portal under Student Administrative Affairs) and must include a valid reason, a current copy of your student transcript, and any support documentation validating your request.  Submission of these requests are done as follows:\nMathematics and Statistics program students must submit a completed student request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in room LB 901-2.  The request will be reviewed by our Pre-University Math Coordinator for MATH 200-209 courses and our Undergraduate Program Director for courses above MATH 209, and will be sent to Student Academic Services of the Arts & Science Faculty.  If it is accepted at that level, the Faculty will remove the student from the course and notify them. The student will also be notified if the Faculty does not accept their request.\nStudents in other programs must contact their home department even if they want to register for one of our courses. \nIndependent students must see an independent student advisor.\nPlease ensure that the student request form is filled properly, otherwise it will cause unecessary delays that may result in the request not being approved. \nHow can I register or withdraw for a course after the registration deadline date?\nLate registration/withdrawal requests are done through a \"Student Request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form\" (found on your MyConcordia Portal under Student Administrative Affairs) and must include a valid reason, a current copy of your student transcript, written permission from the instructor of the course/section, and any support documentation validating your request.  Submission of these requests are done as follows:\nMathematics and Statistics program students must submit a completed student request for Late Registration & Late Withdrawals form to our Undergraduate Program Assistant in room LB 901-2.  The request will be reviewed by our Pre-University Math Coordinator for MATH 200-209 courses and our Undergraduate Program Director for courses above MATH 209, and will be sent to Student Academic Services of the Arts & Science Faculty.  If it is accepted at that level, the Faculty will register the student and notify them.

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

It impacts our lives and the way we do things, and our researchers  are contributing to these developments” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.\n“The patents that Concordia’s innovators have been awarded are the result of years of work, and dedication to the idea of taking research results an extra step and improving a process or a product.”\nFrom inception to commercialization\nMaria Amer , an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was honoured for a noise reduction technology she and her students developed. It improves brightness and colour information in digital images without blurring their details.\nAmer’s new video processing technology is now commercially available through a license deal with wrnch Inc., a company backed up Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban. The video denoising technology was later licensed to Red Giant, an American filmmaking and motion graphics company.\nAmer says her research is driven by the need to innovate, and that commercialization is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n“You cannot fully plan where you go as a researcher,” she adds.\n“I started with a technology in 2009, but it turned out not to be powerful enough against industrial denoisers competition. I felt the challenge to outperform what was currently available on the market, so I asked one of my PhD students to work on this and he excelled.”\nAmer is now working on video object tracking methods. Her goal is to fundamentally advance new technology and scientific knowledge in this area, but if she finds an industry niche, she and her team may turn their attention to applied research.\n \nMaria Amer's video denoising technology has been licensed to Red Giant , an American filmmaking and motion graphics company. | Image courtesy of Pond5 via Red Giant\nInnovating to meet society’s challenges\nEverything from online auction interfaces to self-sealing building materials have been developed at Concordia.\nHere are descriptions of other recently patented inventions:\nBetter braking and steering\nWaizuddin Ahmed , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, specializes in system dynamics and design for road and railway vehicles.\nHe holds a patent on an independently controlled active steering system that not only enhances handling but also improves braking-in-a-turn performance of road vehicles. The independent control is further realized using a fail-safe mechanism and has potential for numerous other applications in active chassis control technology.\nNew dimensions in data\nArmen Atoyan , a senior lecturer of mathematics and statistics in the Faculty of Arts and Science, holds a patent for a new method of record-fast interpolation of data points within a multi-dimensional dataset.\nHis invention is of particular interest for application in the area of digital image processing, including both still and real-time images.\nPurpose-built nanoparticles\nJohn Capobianco , professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, is a specialist in the synthesis, characterization and spectroscopy of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.\nHis patented technology, in part, upconverts nanoparticles’ near-infrared light into the UV, visible and red regions. The results of this research, conducted in collaboration with students and other associates, have attracted considerable attention due their potential biomedical applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.\nSmart sensors for surgery\nJavad Dargahi , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is one of Canada’s leading experts in the application of haptic feedback systems\nIn his work with research associate Saeed Sokhanvar, he developed a patented smart tactile sensor and force and softness haptic feedback systems for robotic applications. His research could be implemented in hospitals offering minimally invasive, endoscopic surgeries.\nStronger, self-healing composites\nSuong Van Hoa , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has had marked success in obtaining patents for new inventions.\nOne area of his research focuses on the detection of defects in composite structures, such as airplanes, automobiles and wind turbines, to ensure that they are safe. His patents include an electrically conductive adhesive sheet for joining structural elements, a self-healing composite material designed to repair cracks and a system for making high-performance epoxies with clay particles.\nNew market mechanisms\nGregory Kersten , a professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, focuses on auctions and negotiations management\nHe developed an innovative market mechanism for procurement in computerized multi-attribute reverse auctions — a situation in which multiple sellers engage in a bidding process with a single buyer. Under Kersten’s mechanism, sellers are constrained to submit bids from admissible sets and the winner is selected by a pre-determined set of the buyer’s preferences that are unknown to the bidders.\nMiniature diagnostic tools\nMuthukumaran Packirisamy , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has been prolific in developing new technologies, having recently patented five new discoveries.\nPackirisamy is a specialist in biomedical microelectromechanical systems, or BioMEMS. Many of his inventions have to do with the miniaturization of photonic components for information technologies and diagnostic tools for health care to detect cancer and other illnesses that may be lurking in a person’s bloodstream. His latest work involves a power cell that harnesses electrical energy from the photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae.\nMore efficient heating systems\nGeorgios Vatistas , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, who has gained international renown for proving Nobel Prize-winner J.J. Thomson’s 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex rings, is an expert in research about how vortices can make energy exchange more economical.\nHis recently patented heat exchanger technology, which uses four to six times less energy to operate and is considerably smaller than a traditional shell-and-tube exchanger, and uses 40 times less energy to operate than the traditional plate heat exchanger, builds on his previous work in swirling water and air flows.\nFind out more about  resources for Concordia researchers .\nPresentations at Concordia's Technology and Innovation Recognition event were also made by some of the university's partners in innovation support, including Aligo Innovation, TandemLaunch and Fasken Martineau.\n \n"}

This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.\n“This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,” said Roy. “I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.” \nThree of this year’s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success.\nDavid Tagliamonti\nBachelor of Science – Actuarial Mathematics\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nMake a reading/homework/study schedule in week one of your term and stick to it.\nPush yourself to ask \"why?\" This will deepen your understanding of course material.\nStay healthy. Regularly playing a sport or going to the gym will keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused in school.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nA problem often has many solutions. The science is in finding a solution; the art is in finding the best one.\nUniversity is a great time to learn from others — not just professors, but fellow students as well.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nKeep learning long after your formal education comes to an end.\nCristy Vista\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nListen earnestly to your professors when they give a lecture, and to your colleagues when they share their thoughts. Understanding others can widen our own perspective.\nDon't let confusion build up — it can hamper learning. Clarify concepts or processes you don't understand as soon as you hear about them.\nLearning should not be a lonely process. When you're having a hard time, ask for help. Concordia has many resources you can tap.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nInformation is never neutral. It must not be simply digested, but carefully examined and reflected on.\nThe world is built in a way that we are unequal and completely reliant on each other. The comforts we may have are at the expense of others, and this makes us our brother’s keeper.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nStudying to just get the grade can be tedious and off-putting. Relate your coursework to your passions, long-term goals and aspirations. This approach can give you encouragement during difficult times. \n \nBachelor of Arts – Linguistics\nThree keys to a good education:\nFirst off, it requires professors that not only teach what they love, but who teach you how to think critically and nurture high-quality ignorance. In other words, they teach you how to express your curiosity in meaningful and practical ways.\nA good education is one that helps you develop skills that will serve you throughout your entire life.\nFinally, it involves a network of people that constantly encourage and motivate you to thrive.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nThere are many resources in place to help us succeed at Concordia. We are fortunate to have advisors, committees and activities for everyone.\nI also learned to take classes from different departments. FAS has hundreds of different courses offered. This allows us to view the world from multiple perspectives.\nOne piece of advice to fellow students:\nBe resilient and passionate — the rest will follow!\n \n"}

That ability has certainly helped her in her career with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) LLP in Montreal.\n \nHer experience and expertise has also led Miriam to be named a recipient of the Women’s Executive Network’s (WXN) 2015 Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Awards. She was honoured at a gala hosted by the WXN at The Westin Montreal in April.\nMiriam Pozza is a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in Montreal and leads the Deals practice in Quebec. This year she celebrates a quarter-century with the company. | Photo credit: Claudia Landry\n“It’s always nice to have recognition when you put effort into your work, your personal development and the development of your team,” she says.\nAt Concordia, Pozza studied in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. “I was interested in anything that had to do with numbers and understanding our economy through numbers,” she says. “That’s what led me to the world of finance.”\nPozza joined the professional services network of PwC in 1991.\nShe says that her passion in assisting entrepreneurs and corporations in their growth has led her into the world of mergers and acquisitions.\nShe’s worked determinedly to distinguish herself in this competitive field.\n \nAfter spending several years in both the auditing and valuation departments — eventually receiving designations as a Chartered Professional Accountant and Chartered Business Valuator — Pozza became Deals leader for the Quebec Region in 2013.\n \nHer main function, she explains, is to help her colleagues work together towards the common goal of accompanying clients in their transactions. Aspects of the job that she finds particularly rewarding are the challenges of completing a deal, and helping companies grow to meet their full potential.\n \nPozza says her commitment to personal and professional development, coupled with her natural leadership qualities, has made her an important asset to the various organizations she has supported throughout her career.\n \n“If you view yourself as fortunate, and I do, I think giving back to the community is rewarding,” she says.\n \nFor 10 years, Pozza lent her accounting skills to the YWCA Montreal by acting as a treasurer on its board of directors. She also sits on the fundraising committee of La Fondation Armand-Frappier, a research institute in the life sciences sector.\n \n“Medicine and wellbeing were always something that I found of great interest,” she says, adding that her ambition was to become a doctor when she was younger.\n \nPozza also supports the advancement of women to leadership positions through her directorship with the Quebec Association of Women in Finance (AFFQ). In 2012, the AFFQ awarded her the Recognition Award for her tireless dedication.\n“I find it important to be part of this association and to specifically assist women in their development, by helping them build a network and develop their skills,” she says.\n \nDescribed previously by PwC CEO Bill McFarland as a natural mentor, Pozza believes strongly that building a network of mentors helps women develop their careers in the long run.\n \nThe best mentors, she says, will take an interest in your values and guide you out of your comfort zone. “Sometimes you need that little push to take some risks.”\n#CUalumni\n"}

They stood beside posters bearing details about their work terms and what they had gained from their various on-the-job experiences.\nMegan Brown, who graduated from Concordia’s computer science program last fall, spent her final work term at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, where she developed an application for a remote-controlled car that can be operated using any Windows 10 device.\nBrown has accepted a job with the software behemoth, and she’s relocating to Washington in a few weeks.\nComputer engineering student Vincent Bilodeau spent his last work term at the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, optimizing audio effects and performing hardware performance profiling. “It’s pretty cool, you get to work on something, then play guitar, work on it a little more, then play some more guitar,” he said, smiling.\nBilodeau has a few courses left before he graduates, but he signed a contract for freelance work with Fender this summer, and he’s hopeful about his prospects for a future with the company.\nAccountancy student Nicholas Chin recently completed a work term at the professional services company KPMG where he helped corporate executives with their personal tax returns. He’s found his passion, he said. But before looking for his first job after he graduates this spring, he’s going to take some time off to travel. The ticket to Italy’s already booked. \n \nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi (far left) and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau (second from left) shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award.\nCo-op’s $8 million contribution\nHughes provided some figures to illustrate the program’s growth and diversity: Currently there are more than 40 Co-op programs at Concordia, including three new ones this year, in mathematical and computational finance , biology and aerospace engineering .\nClose to 1,800 students are enrolled as Co-op members, and they secured 1,400 work placements over the past year. On an annual basis, students in the program earn in the neighbourhood of $8 million. “This helps them with their education, but it also helps the local economy,” Hughes said.\nA vital bridge\nCatherine Bolton , Concordia’s vice-provost for teaching and learning, compared Co-op to a bridge, connecting the classroom to the workplace. “It results in an increase of possibilities — to communicate, to meet, to work together and to learn from each other,” she said. “This bridge partnership is vital to us, not only at the Co-op institute but also at Concordia.”\nBolton underlined the role Co-op’s experiential learning opportunities play in Concordia’s new strategic directions.\n“ Embrace the city, embrace the world speaks to the idea that Concordians can use their talents, expertise and energy to affect social change and to give back to the community that we live in, whether it's locally or globally,” Bolton said. “It is very clear that Co-op students and Co-op employers have long been helping us to achieve this goal.”\nCo-op’s ‘win-win’\nCo-op employer Angela D’Angelo, vice-president of training and client experience at National Bank Financial, highlighted the benefits of hiring Co-op students. “It’s win-win. It’s a two-way street,” she said. “You have no idea what these millennials can bring to your business, to your life and to your development.”\nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award .\nDe Masi said being a part of Co-op allowed her to face her fears and anxieties head on and develop the confidence needed to decide her career direction. “I've learned that it's important not to let people place you in a labelled box and tell you that that’s what you have to be in life,” she said. “I'll kick the box open and politely say, ‘No, thank you.’”\nBoudreau praised Co-op for allowing students to gain invaluable experience while working for employers who take a vested interest in developing their interns. “I really experienced this working on flight simulators and antennas for satellites. It was really remarkable to work with so many employers who would just listen, and be there when you needed help,” he said.\n“I learned to think a little less like a student and a little more like an engineer, and it reflected in the way that I came back to school.”\n"}

Any town or city can take part in it. Nowadays, participants are from over 120 cities from more than 25 countries.\nThe main goal of this tournament is to provide an opportunity for a large number of students to participate in a competition with worldwide standards. Some problems can be very challenging, yet they require creative use of simple tools rather than advanced mathematical knowledge.\nThe Tournament is held each year in two rounds - Spring and Fall. Students and their towns can take part in either round or both. Each round has two levels - O-Level (training - junior) and A-Level (main - senior).\nUsually, students from grade 7-10 participate in O-level (Junior), while students from grade 11-12 participate in A-level, Senior level. Students from Quebec colleges can only participate in Senior level.\nExcept for college student, other students have the right of choosing the level in which they participate – thus students from grades 11-12 can participate in O-level. The scoring of the problems takes into account the student’s grade and the level in which he/she participate.\nThe contest is written individually, but there is both an individual and a team result. At individual level, the score is calculated out of the highest marks to three problems from either of the rounds. The town’s score for the contest is calculated out of the best individual scores.\nFor more information, and problems from previous editions, please visit the contest’s site at University of Toronto:  http://www.math.toronto.edu/oz/turgor/index.php\nIf you have questions, please contact the organizers at montrealmathclub@gmail.com\nNext tournament\nThe O-level contest will be held on October 9th, while the A-level competition will be held on October 23rd.\nIf interested in participating, please contact us at montrealmathclub@gmail.com   by October 1st and specify name, grade level, and contact information.\nIn Montreal, participation in the Tournament of Towns is facilitated by Concordia's Department of Mathematics and Statistics and l’Institut des sciences mathématiques (ISM).\nPlease note:  We reserve the right to take photographs during our outreach activities or events and use them for promotional purposes.

{"url": "http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/math-stats/programs/co-op.html", "field": "artsci_math", "title": "Co-op programs", "text": "GooglePlus\nCo-op programs\nThe Mathematics and Statistics Co-operative program is offered to undergraduate students who are enrolled in the BA or BSc Honours or Specialization programs.\nStudents interested in applying for the Mathematics and Statistics co-op should refer to  §24 of the Undergraduate Calendar  where a full description of the admission requirements is provided, and should complete  this Co-op application form .\nAcademic content is identical to that of the regular program, but six study terms are interspersed with four work terms (except for MACF which has three work terms). Students are supervised personally and must meet the requirements specified by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Institute for Co-operative Education in order to continue their studies in the co-op format.\nLiaison between the student, the employers, and the Institute for Co-operative Education is provided by the Mathematics and Statistics Co-op Committee, which includes the student's advisors. Please refer to  §24 of the Undergraduate Calendar  for the schedule of study and work terms and the full description of admission requirements.\nCo-op admission process \nCo-op students are usually admitted in September, after obtaining their cégep diploma. In some cases, they are also admitted in January if their academic and professional profiles make it easy for them to integrate into the regular work-study pattern of their program. For MACF students, there is no direct entry and students may only apply to the Co-op program after completing one term at Concordia.  The criteria for admission into a co-op program in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics include academic excellence and work experience. Admission is a two-stage process: In order to be eligible for co-op, students must have already been admitted to the University. The Department then selects suitable candidates through a personal interview process. Students are invited for an interview if their academic record and the additional material which they submit are considered promising. If found suitable, students are recommended to the Institute for Co-operative Education for admission to their chosen program. In order to be admitted into a co-operative program, students must demonstrate that, in addition to academic excellence, they possess or can acquire quickly the language, writing, computing, and interpersonal skills required by employers.  The number of places in the programs is limited by the identified opportunities for employment at a given time and by the resources available within the University to provide students with suitable professional guidance and support.\nAcademic achievements & standards\nOver the years, co-op students in Actuarial Mathematics, Pure and Applied Mathematics, and Statistics have proven to be among Concordia's best graduates. They invariably receive awards and medals for their academic achievements and the Dean's Honour Roll is usually speckled with the names of these students.\nIn order to maintain the strong academic standards of the program, students in satisfactory standing will be required to maintain a G.P.A. of 3.0 or better.  Normally such students will have no grade less than a C-.  Students with a G.P.A. between 2.7 and 3.0 will have probationary status.   Students with a G.P.A. of less than 2.7 will be asked to leave the program.\nWork terms\nThe co-operative programs in Actuarial Mathematics, Pure & Applied Mathematics, and Statistics involve four compulsory work terms, each lasting at least twelve weeks. For students entering a first-year university program in September, the first work term begins in May of the next calendar year. After that, students alternate work and study terms. For MACF which has three work terms, see the activity flow chart in §24 of the Undergraduate Calendar .\nAt the end of a work term, all students must write and are graded on a work-term report. Although the University maintains a network of employers and makes every effort to help students find work term placements, it is up to the students to convince employers in interviews to hire them as full-time employees for a work term. Students on a work term are considered full-time employees and are paid a regular salary commensurate with their level of seniority.\nWho hires Co-op students?\nThe Department's network of employers of co-op students includes the Quebec and other provincial governments, the federal government, as well as the private sector, consulting firms, financial institutions, insurance companies, R&D based companies, software companies, and research organizations. Concordia Co-op students are regularly employed in major Canadian cities from Halifax to Vancouver as well as in the US, England, France, Australia, and other countries.\nEmployers hire Mathematics Co-op students for two main reasons: i) because they need bright people with good analytical skills and problem-solving experience to fill short-term vacancies; and ii) to engage in a risk-free search for future employees. Some companies actually consider co-op graduates to be their most valuable human resource. Several employers are themselves graduates of a Concordia co-op program and are enthusiastic supporters of the next generation of co-op students.\nThe Co-op curriculum\nCo-op students in Mathematics and Statistics follow the regular academic programs in their area. Specialized courses are sometimes available on a tutorial basis if needed. Students in Actuarial Mathematics, on the other hand, follow a discipline-based curriculum. It includes workshops which prepare the students for external professional examinations.\nThe employability of Co-op students\nMany employers have discovered that even in non-mathematical fields, Mathematics graduates with good professional skills are among their most valuable employees. Because of the integration of the co-op curriculum into the regular mathematics streams, graduates of the Actuarial Mathematics, MACF, Pure & Applied Mathematics, and Statistics co-op programmes at Concordia University have demonstrated consistently that they possess superior analytical, problem-solving, and organizational skills, and have excellent employment prospects.\nRelated office\n"}

It is a cost-free option, even for those without access to Mathematica, and works with cdf-formatted electronic textbooks, research papers, and journal articles.\nThe list goes on.\nExamples illustrating these features are taken from EC Math 208, Math 212, Mast 232, Mast 235, and the forthcoming Math 616 graduate course in linear algebra.\nTitle:\nNon-Convex Conservation Laws : Models of Balanced Diffusion and Dispersion\nSpeaker:\nDr. Marc Laforest (Visiting Professor from École Polytechnique de Montréal)\nDate:\nJanuary 28, 2013\nAbstract:\nConservation laws are first order models of continuum mechanics that are degenerate in the sense that higher order stabilizing physics, for example diffusion (2nd order) and dispersion (3rd order), are neglected. For convex conservation laws, the first law of thermodynamics renders the models stable by imposing that the entropy must increase. For non-convex conservation laws, like the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics or of certain thin film flows, entropy growth is not a sufficient criteria to obtain stability. Typically, physicists look for solutions that are limits of a purely diffusive regularization and in that case, the well-posedness has been established through the combined efforts of several researchers.\nIn this talk, we will discuss the well-posedness problem for non-convex conservation laws in the presence of more general regularizations, with particular emphasis on an approach developed by Philippe G. LeFloch of Paris VI. Roughly speaking, we will attempt to study solutions to conservation laws where the rate of growth of entropy, and not just its sign, is determined a priori. We present a class of solutions called splitting-merging that illustrate the inherent difficulties in this problem. Following recent work of the author and LeFloch, we introduce a new definition of total variation that allows one to successfully extend Glimm's techniques to scalar conservation laws, and to some weak perturbations of strong waves in systems.\nTitle:\nOn Different Approaches to Teaching Prerequisite, Pre-University Mathematics Courses to Mature Students\nSpeaker:\n"}

Due to their construction, finite mixture models are a natural choice for performing cluster analysis. When a finite mixture model is utilized for cluster analysis, we call the process model-based clustering. To date, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) has been the focal point in the development of finite mixtures for clustering. However, the GMM assumes that clusters are symmetric, which is often an unrealistic assumption. This talk discusses the development of a finite mixture of shifted asymmetric Laplace (SAL) distributions, which facilitate clustering, or classification, in situations where the clusters are not symmetric. The mixture of SAL distributions allow for the parameterization of skewness, in addition to location and scale, and are a substantial departure from the Gaussian model-based clustering paradigm. The mixture of SAL distributions are fitted using a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and we demonstrate our novel mixture modelling approach using simulated and real data sets. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and integrated complete likelihood(ICL) are utilized for model selection. Finally, extensions of the general SAL mixture that arise by decomposing the component scale matrices are also discussed.\nTitle:\nBayesian Learning, A Framework for Automatic Learning from Big Data  \nSpeaker:\nDr. Vahid Partovi Nia (École Polytechnique de Montréal)\nDate:\n"}

The target population is those students performing in the bottom quartile on state and national tests. The Algebra Project seeks to stimulate a demand for math literacy in the young people themselves. The Algebra Project has developed a cohort model that we predict will stimulate and enable students to pass the mandated tests in mathematics, and to score well enough on the SAT or ACT to enter college, and place into non-remedial mathematics courses. A key component of the emerging model is the development and testing of new high school curricular materials based on common experiences, activities, and dialogs. We will describe the development of the geometry curricular materials, their base in experiential activities, and the dialogs that replace the paragraph-based text of most textbooks. We observe as an immediate effect of these materials: 1. Students are discussing their mathematical ideas with each other. 2. Students want to and enjoy reading the curricular materials and responding to the mathematical problems posed. 3. Students interact in writing with the text, actively commenting on, questioning and reacting to the mathematical meanings in their own words. \nBack to top\n"}

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

The Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with a Tweedie response distribution are analyzed as a method for this estimation. This approach is compared against the standard practice in the industry of combining estimations obtained separately for the frequency and severity by using GLMs with Poisson and gamma responses respectively. We show that one important difference between these two methods is the variation of the scale parameter of the compound Poisson-gamma distribution when it is parametrized as an exponential dispersion model. We conclude that both approaches need to be considered during the process of model selection for the pure premium.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Petr Zorin (M.Sc.)\nDate: Tuesday, August 23, 2011\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: The Discrete Spectra of Dirac Operators\nAbstract: A single particle is bound by an attractive central potential and obeys the Dirac equation in d dimensions. The Coulomb potential is one of the few examples for which exact analytical solutions are available. A geometrical approach called 'the potential envelope method' is used to study the discrete spectra generated by potentials V(r) that are smooth transformations V(r) = g(-1/r) of the soluble Coulomb potential. When g has definite convexity, the method leads to energy bounds. This is possible because of the recent comparison theorems for the Dirac equation. The results are applied to study soft-core Coulomb potentials used as models for confined atoms. The estimates are compared with accurate eigen values found by numerical methods.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Anne Mackay (M.Sc.)\nDate: Monday, August 22, 2011\nTime: 1:00 p.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Pricing and Hedging Equity-Linked Products Under Stochastic Volatility Models\nAbstract: Equity-indexed annuities (EIAs) are becoming increasingly interesting for investors as market volatility increases. Simultaneously, they represent a higher risk for insurers, which amplifies the need for hedging strategies that perform well when index returns present unexpected changes in their volatility. In this thesis, we introduce hedging strategies that aim at reducing the risk of the financial guarantees embedded in EIAs.\nWe first derive closed-form expressions for the price and the Greeks of a point-to-point EIA under the Heston model, which assumes stochastic volatility. To do so, we rely on the similarity between the payoff of a European call option and that of the EIA. We use the Greeks to develop dynamic hedging strategies that aim at reducing equity and volatility risk. Using Monte Carlo simulations to derive the distribution of the resulting hedging errors, we compare the performance of hedging strategies that use the Greeks derived under the Heston model to other strategies based on Greeks developed under Black-Scholes.\nWe show that, when the market is Hestonian, the performance of hedging strategies developed in a Black-Scholes framework are significantly affected by the calibration of the model and the volatility risk premium. We further show that the performance of a simple delta hedging strategy using Heston Greeks is also reduced by the presence of a volatility risk premium, and that this performance can be improved by incorporating gamma or vega hedging to the strategy. We conclude by recommending the use of a delta-vega hedging strategy to reduce model calibration and volatility risk.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Mengjue Tang (M.Sc.)\nDate: Tuesday, July 26, 2011\nTime: 10:30 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: A Comparison of Two Nonparametric Density Estimators in the Context of Actuarial Loss Model\nAbstract: In this thesis, I will introduce two estimation methods for estimating loss function in actuarial science. Both of them are related to nonparametric density estimation (kernel smoothing). One is deriving from kernel smoothing which is called semi-parametric transformation kernel smoothing while another one derives from Hille's lemma and perturbation idea which is quite similar to kernel smoothing. As the increasing frequently used of nonparametric density estimation in many areas, actuaries are more likely to use this kind of simple method when doing decision-making. There are now existing many nonparametric density estimation methods, but which one is better? In order to compare the two methods which are introduced in this thesis, I conduct simulation study on both of them and try to find out which one is preferable and easier to apply. Also the second method which derives from Hille's lemma gives us a new idea about how to estimate loss function when we are doing decision-making in actuarial science.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Ramin Okhrati (Ph.D.)\nDate: Monday, July 25, 2011\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Credit Risk Modeling under Jump Processes and under a Risk Measure-Based Approach\nAbstract: (Click here to view)\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Li Ma (Ph.D.)\nDate: Monday, June 27, 2011\nTime: 2:00 p.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Generalized Feynman-Kac Transformation and Fukushima's Decomposition for Nearly Symmetric Markov Processes\nAbstract: (Click here to view)\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Yasmine Raad (M.Sc.)\nDate: Wednesday, June 22, 2011\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Comparison theorems for the principal eigenvalue of the Laplacian\nAbstract: We study the Faber - Krahn inequality for the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian, first in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, then on a compact smooth Riemannian manifold $M$. For the latter, we consider two cases. In the first case, the compact manifold has a lower bound on the Ricci curvature, in the second, the integral of the reciprocal of an isoperimetric estimator function of the Riemannian manifold is convergent. In all cases, we show that the first eigenvalue of a domain in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, respectively $M$, is minimal for the ball of the same volume, respectively, for a geodesic ball of the same relative volume in an appropriate manifold $M^\\ast$. While working with the isoperimetric estimator, the manifold $M^\\ast$ need not have constant sectional curvature. In $\\mathbb{R}^N$, we also consider the Neumann eigenvalue problem and present the Szeg\\\"o - Weinberger inequality. In this case, the principal eigenvalue of the ball is maximal among all principal eigenvalues of domains with same volume.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Alexandre Laurin (M.Sc.)\nDate: Friday, April 1, 2011\nTime: 1:30 p.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: On Duncan's characterization of McKay's monstrous E_8\nAbstract: McKay's Monstrous $E_8$ observation has provided further evidence, along with the evidence provided by the study of Monstrous Moonshine, that the Monster is intimately linked with a wide spectrum of other mathematical objects and, one might even say, with the natural organization of the universe. Although these links have been observed and facts about them proved, we have yet to understand exactly where and how they originate. We here review a set of conditions, due to Duncan, imposed on arithmetic subgroups of $PSL2(R)$ that return McKay's Monstrous $E_8$ diagram. The purpose is to compare these with Conway, McKay and Sebbar's (CMS) conditions that return the complete set of Monstrous Moonshine groups in order to gain some insight on their meaning. By way of doing this review of Duncan's conditions, we will also review and elaborate on Conway's method for understanding groups like $\\Gamma_0(N)$.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Jun Li (Ph.D.)\nDate: Monday, November 29, 2010\nTime: 1:30 p.m.\nRoom: H 762 (Concordia University, Hall Building, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Some Contributions to Nonparametric Estimation of Density and Related Functionals for Biased Data\nAbstract: Length biased sampling as a special case of biased sampling occurs naturally in many statistical applications. One aspect regarding length biased data in which people are interested is estimating the underlying true density with the observed samples. Since most length biased data are nonnegative, the true density has a support with a non-negative finite end point. The current proposed kernel density estimators with symmetric kernels may have large bias at the lower boundary. In this thesis, we propose some new smooth density estimators with weights generating from Poisson distribution or nonnegative asymmetric kernels for length biased data to take care of the edge effect. Besides density estimators, we also consider smooth estimators of distribution function and functions related to distribution and density function, such as hazard function and mean residual life function. Our methods are easily to extend to the general biased data as well.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Di Xu (M.Sc.)\nDate: Friday, November 26, 2010\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: The Range Time for Jump Diffusion with Two-Sided Exponential Jumps\nAbstract: The range time for a stochastic process is the stopping time when the difference between its running maximum and running minimum first exceeds a certain level. It has been studied by several authors for random walks and diffusion processes. In this presentation we consider a jump diffusion process with two-sided exponential jumps. By a martingale approach, we first solve the two-sided exit problem for this jump diffusion process. Using solutions to the exit problem, we then obtain several results concerning the range time related to joint distributions for the jump diffusion.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Janine Bachrachas (M.Sc.)\nDate: Monday, November 22, 2010\nTime: 1:30 p.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: On the Mean Curvature Flow\nAbstract: We present a self-contained expository review on the mean curvature flow for smooth embedded hypersurfaces in the (n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space. We start by addressing the short time existence of solutions to the flow, followed by the long time existence in the case of compact convex hypersurfaces and entire graphs. Although the results presented here are part of the classical literature originated in the 80âs, we derive all necessary calculations and gather the simplest possible approach in view of later developments of the area.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Yafang Wang (Ph.D.)\nDate: Friday, October 29, 2010\nTime: 3:30 p .m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Hall Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: The Distribution of the Discounted Compound PH-Renewal Process\nAbstract: The family of phase--type (PH) distributions has many useful properties such as closure under convolution and mixtures, as well as rational Laplace transforms. PH distributions are widely used in applications of stochastic models such as in queuing systems, biostatics and engineering. They are also applied to insurance risk, such as in ruin theory.  In this thesis, we extend the work of Wang (2007), that discussed the moment generating function (mgf) of discounted compound sums with PH inter--arrival times under a nonzero net interest rate. Here we focus on the distribution of the discounted compound sums. This represents a generalization of the classical risk model for which the net interest rate is zero.  A differential equation system is derived for the mgf of a discounted compound sum with PH inter--arrival times and any claim severity if its mgf exists. For some PH inter-arrival times, we can further simplify this differential equation system. If the matrix is order of 2, an ordinary differential equation is developed for PH inter-arrival times. By inverting the corresponding Laplace transforms, the density functions and cumulative distribution functions are also obtained. In addition, the series and transformation methods for solving differential equations are discussed, when the mean of inter-arrival times is small.  Applications such as stop-loss premiums, and risk measures such as VaR and CTE are investigated. These are compared for different inter-arrival times. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.  Finally asymptotic results have been discussed, when the mean inter-arrival time goes to zero. We obtain normality to approximate compound renewal processes. The asymptotic normal distribution is also derived for the discounted compound renewal sum at a fixed time.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Xinghua Zhou (M.Sc.)\nDate: Thursday, September 2, 2010\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Stochastic Flow and FBSDE Approaches to Quadratic Term Structure Models\nAbstract: We study the stochastic flow method and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) approach to Quadratic Term Structure Models (QTSMs). Applying the stochastic flow approach, we get a closed form solution for the zero-coupon bond price under a one-dimensional QTSM. However, in the higher dimensional cases, the stochastic flow approach is difficult to implement. Therefore, we solve the n-dimensional QTSMs by implementing the FBSDE approach, which shows that the zero-coupon bond price under QTSM provided some Riccati type equations have global solutions.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Wenxia Li (M.Sc.)\nDate: Friday, August 27, 2010\nTime: 10:30 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Optimal Surrender and Asset Allocation Strategies for Equity-Indexed Insurance Investors\nAbstract: Equity-indexed annuity (EIA) products is getting more and more popular since first introduced in 1995. An EIA investor may consider surrendering the contract before maturity and invest in the stock index in order to earn the full stock growth. We consider an EIA policyholder who seeks the optimal surrender strategy and asset allocation strategy after surrender in order to maximize his expected discounted utility at the maturity of the contract or his time of death, whichever comes first. The optimal value functions satisfy Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations from which the optimal strategies are derived.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Ferenc Balogh (Ph.D.)\nDate: Tuesday, July 20, 2010\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\nRoom: H 443 (Concordia University, Hall Building, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Orthogonal Polynomials, Equilibrium Measures and Quadrature Domains Associated with Random Matrix Models\nAbstract: Motivated by asymptotic questions related to the spectral theory of complex random matrices, this work focuses on the asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials with respect to quasi-harmonic potentials in the complex plane. The ultimate goal is to develop new techniques to obtain strong asymptotics (asymptotic expansions valid uniformly on compact\nsubsets) for planar orthogonal polynomials and use these results to understand the limiting behavior of spectral statistics of matrix models as their size goes to infinity. For orthogonal polynomials on the real line the powerful Riemann--Hilbert approach is the main analytic tool to derive asymptotics for the eigenvalue correlations in Hermitian matrix models. As yet, no such method is available to obtain asymptotic information about planar orthogonal polynomials, but some steps in this direction have been taken.  The results of this thesis concern the connection between the asymptotic behavior of orthogonal polynomials and the corresponding equilibrium measure. It is conjectured that this connection is established via a quadrature identity: under certain conditions the weak-star limit of the normalized zero counting measure of the orthogonal polynomials is a quadrature measure for the support of the equilibrium measure of the corresponding two-dimensional electrostatic variational problem of the underlying potential.  Several results are presented on equilibrium measures, quadrature domains, orthogonal polynomials and their relation to matrix models. In particular, complete strong asymptotics are obtained for the simplest nontrivial quasi-harmonic potential by a contour integral reduction method and the Riemann-Hilbert approach, which confirms the above conjecture for this special case.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Farhat Abohalfya (Ph.D.)\nDate: Tuesday, May 11, 2010\nTime: 1:00 p.m.\nRoom: H 443 (Concordia University, Hall Building, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: On RG-spaces and the Space of Prime d-ideals in C(X)\nAbstract: Let A be a commutative semiprime ring with identity. Then A has at least two epimorphic regular extensions namely, the universal epimorphic regular extension T(A), and the epimorphic hull H(A). We are mainly interested in the case of C(X), the ring of real-valued continuous functions defined on a Tychonoff space X. It is a commutative semiprime ring with identity and it has another important epimorphic regular extension namely, the minimal regular extension G(X). In our study we show in chapter 5 that the spectrum of the ring H(A) with the spectral topology is homeomorphic to the space of the prime Îž-ideals in A with the patch topology. In the case of C(X), the spectrum of the epimorphic hull H(X) with the spectral topology is homeomorphic to the space of prime d-ideals in C(X) with the patch topology.\nA Tychonoff space X which satisfies the property that G(X) = C(XÎ´) is called an RG-space. We shall introduce a new class of topological spaces namely the class of almost k-Baire spaces, and as a special case of this class we shall have the class of almost Baire spaces. We show that every RG-space is an almost Baire space but it need not be a Baire space. However, in the case of RG-spaces of countable pseudocharacter, RG-spaces have to be Baire spaces. Furthermore, in this case every dense set in RG-spaces has a dense interior.\nThe Krull z-dimension and the Krull d-dimension will play an important role to determine which of the extensions H(X) and G(X) has the form of a ring of real-valued continuous functions on some topological space. In [31] the authors gave some techniques to prove that there is no RG-space with infinite Krull z-dimension, but there was an error that we found in the proof of theorem 3.4. In this study, we will give an accurate proof which applies to many spaces but the general theorem will remain open. And we will use the same techniques to prove that if C(X) has an infinite chain of prime d-ideals then H(X) cannot be isomorphic to a ring of real-valued continuous functions.\nSpeaker: Ms. Noushin Sabetghadam Haghighi (Ph.D.)\nDate: Thursday, April 8, 2010\nTime: 3:00 p.m.\nRoom: LB 649 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: On Larcher Subgroups and Fourier Coefficients of Modular Forms\nAbstract: This work consists of two parts, both revolving around Monstrous moonshine. First we compute the signature of Generalized Larcher subgroups. These subgroups were first introduced by Larcher to prove his result about the cusp widths of any congruence subgroup. They also played a significant role in the classification of torsion-free low genus congruence subgroups. In the second part, we establish universal recurrence formulae satisfied by the Fourier coefficients of meromorphic modular forms on moonshine-type subgroups.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Huan Yi Li (M.Sc.)\nDate: Wednesday, April 7 , 2010\nTime: 10:30 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Analyzing Equity-Indexed Annuities Using Lee-Carter Stochastic Mortality Model\nAbstract: Equity-indexed annuity (EIA) insurance products have become more and more popular since being introduced in 1995. Some of the most important characteristics of these products are that they allow the policyholders to benefit from the equity marketâs potential growth and ensure that the principals can grow with a minimum guaranteed interest rate. In this thesis, we show how to derive the closed-form pricing formula of a point-to-point (PTP) financial guarantee, using the Black-Scholes framework. Furthermore, the PTP equity-indexed annuity is discussed in details as well. We will show how to construct the replicating portfolio for both the PTP financial guarantee and the PTP equity-indexed annuity. Because in the real financial market, companies cannot trade continuously, which violates the assumptions of the complete-market, the replicating portfolio will generate hedging errors. The distributions of the present values hedging errors for both the financial guarantee and EIA will be shown. In addition, the distribution of the present values of hedging errors will be showed. We will talk about the impacts on the hedging errors caused by the stochastic mortality rates in the end of the thesis.\n \nSpeaker: Mr. Colin Grabowski (M.Sc.)\nDate: Wednesday, March 31 , 2010\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Local Torsion on Elliptic Curves\nAbstract: Let E be an elliptic curve over Q.

The complexity of these models increases as we include more factors affecting the genetic composition of the population under consideration. In this thesis, we focus on interactions among evolutionary forces in finite and infinite populations. In the first part of the thesis we study the effect of migration between two populations of equal sizes with mutations occurring between two alleles at the locus under study.\nStochastic changes in the frequencies of one of the alleles in the population is described by a two-dimensional diffusion process. The stationary distribution of this process is characterized by identifying the joint moments under the stationary measure. The second part of this thesis is devoted to studying the effect of recombination on the distribution of types in an infinite haploid population with selection and mutation. In particular, we study the frequency of an allele promoting recombination in such a population. The dynamics of this system are studied in a deterministic framework where the distribution of types is described by a system of ordinary differential equations. We provide numerical solutions to this system. Our results suggest that even if there is no epistatic interaction among loci under selection, an increased rate of deleterious mutations provides a sufficient condition for recombination to be favored in the population.\nSpeaker: Mr. Zhaoyang Wu (M.Sc.)\nDate: Monday, January 25, 2010\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Predicting Stock Index Based on Grey Theory, Arima Model and Wavelet Methods\nAbstract: In this thesis, we develop a new forecasting method by merging traditional statistical methods with innovational non-statistical theories for the purpose of improving prediction accuracy of stock time series. The method is based on a novel hybrid model which combines the grey model, the ARIMA model and wavelet methods. First of all, we improve the traditional GM (1, 1) model to the GM (1, 1, u, v) model by introducing two parameters: the grey coefficient u and the grey dimension degree v. Then we revise the normal G-ARMA model by merging the ARMA model with the GM (1, 1, u, v) model. In order to overcome the drawback of directly modeling original stock time series, we introduce wavelet methods into the revised-ARMA model and name this new hybrid model WG-ARMA model. Finally, we obtain the WPG-ARMA model by replacing the wavelet transform with the wavelet packets decomposition. To keep consistency, all the proposed models are merged into a single model by estimating parameters simultaneously based on the total absolute error (TAE) criterion. To verify prediction performance of the models, we present case studies for the models based on the leading Canadian stock index: S&P/TSX Composite Index on the daily bases. The experimental results give the rank of predictive ability in terms of the TAE, MPAE and DIR metrics as following :WPG-ARMA,WG-ARMA,G-ARMA,GM(1,1,u,v),ARIMA.\nSpeaker: Mr. Radu Gaba (Ph.D.)\nDate: Tuesday, September 15, 2009\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\nRoom: H 769 (Concordia University, Hall Building, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: On Fontaine Sheaves\nAbstract: In this thesis we focus our research on constructing two new types of Fontaine sheaves, Armax and Amax in the third chapter and the fourth one respectively and in proving some of their main properties, most important the localization over small affines. This pair of new sheaves plays a crucial role in generalizing a comparison isomorphism theorem of Faltings for the ramified case. In the first chapter we introduce the concept of p-adic Galois representation and provide and analyze some examples. The second chapter is an overview of the Fontaine Theory. We define the concept of semi-linear representation and study the period rings introduced by Fontaine while understanding their importance in classifying the p-adic Galois representations.\n \nSpeaker: Ms. Klara Kelecsenyi (Ph.D.)\nDate: Thursday, September 3, 2009\nTime: 2:00 p.m.\nRoom: H 760 (Concordia University, Hall Building, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Popularization of Mathematics as Intercultural Communication â An Exploratory Study\nAbstract: Popularization of mathematics seems to have gained importance in the past decades. Besides the increasing number of popular books and lectures, there are national and international initiatives, usually supported by mathematical societies, to popularize mathematics. Despite this apparent attention towards it, studying popularization has not become an object of research; little is known about how popularizers choose the mathematical content of popularization, what means they use to communicate it, and how their audiences interpret popularized mathematics. This thesis presents a framework for studying popularization of mathematics and intends to investigate various questions related to the phenomenon, such as:\n- What are the institutional characteristics of popularization?\n- What are the characteristics of the mathematical content chosen to be popularized?\n- What are the means used by popularizers to communicate mathematical ideas?\n- Who are popularizers and what do they think about popularization?\n- Who are audience members of a popularization event?\n- How audience members interpret popularization?\n \nThe thesis presents methodological challenges of studying popularization and suggests some ideas on the methods that might be appropriate for further studies. Thus it intends to offer a first step for developing suitable means for studying popularization of mathematics.\nSpeaker: Mr. Jeremy Porter (M.Sc.)\nDate: Thursday, September 3, 2009\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: On a Conjecture for the Distributions of Primes Associated with Elliptic Curves\nAbstract: For an elliptic curve E and fixed integer r, Lang and Trotter have conjectured an asymptotic estimate for the number of primes p bounded by x such that the trace of Frobenius equals r. Using similar heuristic reasoning, Koblitz has conjectuerd an asymptotic estimate for the number of primes p bounded by x such that the order of the group of points of E over the finite field of prime characteristic p is also prime. These estimates have been proven correct for elliptic curves âon averageâ; however, beyond this the conjectures both remain open.\nIn this thesis, we combine the condition of Lang and Trotter with that of Koblitz to conjecture an asymptotic for the number of primes p bounded by x such that both the order of the group of points of E over the finite field of characteristic p is prime, and the trace of Frobenius equals r. In the case where E is a Serre curve, we will give an explicit construction for the estimate. As support for the conjecture, we will also provide several examples of Serre curves for which we computed the number of primes p bounded by large x such that the order of the group of points of E over the finite field of characteristic p is prime and the trace of Frobenius equals r, and compared this count with the conjectured estimates.\nSpeaker: Ms. Valerie Hudon (Ph.D.)\nDate: Friday, August 28, 2009\nTime: 10:30 a.m.\nRoom: AD 324 (Concordia University, Administration Building, 7141 Sherbrooke Street W.)\nTitle: Study of the Coadjoint Orbits of the Pointcare Group in 2 + 1 Dimensions and Theiry Coherent States\nAbstract: The first main objective of this thesis is to study the orbit structure of the (2+1)-PoincarĂŠ group (the symmetry group of relativity in two space and one time dimensions) by obtaining an explicit expression for the coadjoint action. From there, we compute and classify the coadjoint orbits. We obtain a degenerate orbit, the upper and lower sheet of the two-sheet hyperboloid, the upper and lower cone and the one-sheet hyperboloid. They appear as two-dimensional coadjoint orbits and, with their cotangent planes, as four-dimensional coadjoint orbits. We also confirm a link between the four-dimensional coadjoint orbits and the orbits of the action of SO(2,1) on the dual of R^(2,1).\nThe second main objective of this thesis is to use the information obtained about the structure to induce a representation and build the coherent states on two of the coadjoint orbits, namely the upper sheet of the two-sheet hyperboloid and the upper cone. We obtain coherent states on the hyperboloid for the principal section. The Galilean and the affine sections only allow us to get frames. On the cone, we obtain a family of coherent states for a generalized principal section and a frame for the basic section.\nSpeaker: Mr. Baohua He (M.Sc.)\nDate: Friday, August 21, 2009\nTime: 2:00 p.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Smoothing Parameter Selection for a New Regression Estimator for Non-Negative Data\nAbstract: In this thesis, cross-validation based smoothing parameter election technique is applied to Chaubey, Laib and Senâs (2008) estimator, which is a new regression estimation for nonnegative random variables. The estimator is based on a generalization of Hille's lemma and a perturbation idea. A second order expansion for mean squared error (MSE) of the estimator is derived and the theoretical optimal values of the smoothing parameters are discussed and calculated. Simulation results and graphical illustrations on the new estimator comparing with Fan's (1992, 2003) local linear regression estimators are provided.\nSpeaker: Ms. Tamanna Howlader (Ph.D.)\nDate: Friday, June 19, 2009\nTime: 1:30 p.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Wavelet-Based Noise Reduction of CDNA Microarray Images\nAbstract: Microarray experiments have greatly advanced our understanding of how genes function by enabling us to examine the activity of thousands of genes simultaneously. In cDNA microarray experiments, information regarding gene activity is extracted from a pair of red and green channel images. These images are often of poor quality since they are corrupted with noise arising from different sources, including the imaging system itself. Inferences based on noisy microarray images can be highly misleading. Many noise reduction algorithms have been proposed for natural images. Among these various methods, those that have been developed in the wavelet transform domain are found to be most successful. Unfortunately, the existing wavelet-based methods are not very efficient for reducing noise in cDNA microarray images because they are only capable of processing the red and green channel images separately. In doing so, they ignore the correlation that exists between the wavelet coefficients of the images in the two channels. This thesis deals with the problem of developing novel wavelet-based methods for reducing noise in cDNA microarray images for the purpose of obtaining accurate information regarding gene activity. Two types of wavelet transforms have been used. The proposed methods use joint statistical models that take into account the inter-channel dependencies for estimation of the noise-free images of the two channels. The performance of the proposed methods is compared with that of other methods through extensive experimentations which are carried out on a large set of microarray images. Results show that the new methods lead to improved noise reduction performance and more accurate estimation of the level of gene activity. Thus, it is expected that these methods will play a significant role in improving the reliability of results obtained from real microarray images.\nSpeaker: Ms. Yuliya Klochko (Ph.D.)\nDate: Monday, May 4, 2009\nTime: 9:30 a.m.\nRoom: LB 646 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Genus One Polyhedral Surfaces, Spaces of Quadratic Differentials On Tori and Determinants of Laplacians\nAbstract: This thesis presents a formula for the determinant of the Laplacian on an arbitrary compact polyhedral surface of genus one. The formula generalizes the well-known Ray-Singer result for a flat torus. A special case of flat conical metrics given by the modulus of a meromorphic quadratic differential on an elliptic curve is also considered. We study the determinant of the Laplacian as a functional on the moduli space of meromorphic quadratic differentials with L simple poles and L simple zeroes and derive formulas form variations of this functional with respect to natural coordinates on this space. We also give a new proof of Troyanov's theorem stating the existence of a conformal flat conical metric on a compact Riemann surface of arbitrary genus with a prescribed divisor of conical points.\nSpeaker: Ms. Olga Veres (Ph.D.)\nDate: Wednesday, April 8, 2009\nTime: 12:15 p.m.\nRoom: H 771 (Concordia University, Hall Building, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: On the Complexity of Polynomial Factorization Over P-adic Fields\nAbstract: Let p be a rational prime and ÎŚ (x) be a monic irreducible polynomial in Zp[x]. Based on the work of Ore on Newton polygons (Ore, 1928) and MacLane's characterization of polynomial valuations (MacLane, 1936), Montes described an algorithm for the decomposition of the ideal pOK over an algebraic number field (Montes, 1999). We give a simplified version of the Montes algorithm with a full Maple implementation which tests the irreducibility of ÎŚ (x) over Qp. We derive an estimate of the complexity of this simplified algorithm in the worst case, when ÎŚ (x) is irreducible over Qp. We show that in this case the algorithm terminates in at most O((deg ÎŚ)^3+-epsilon v_p(disc ÎŚ)^2+\\epsilon) bit operations. Lastly, we compare the \"one-element\" and \"two-element\" variations of the Zassenhaus \"Round Four\" algorithm with the Montes algorithm.\nSpeaker: Ms. Nadia Hardy (Ph.D.)\nDate: Friday, April 3, 2009\nTime: 2:30 p.m.\nRoom: LB 921-4 (Concordia University, Library Building, 1400 de Maisonneuve Blvd. W.)\nTitle: Studentsâ Models of the Knowledge to be Learned About Limits in College Level Calculus Courses. The Influence of Routine Tasks and the Role Played By Institutional Norms\nAbstract: This thesis presents a study of instructors' and students' perceptions of the knowledge to be learned about limits of functions in a college level Calculus course, taught in a North American college institution. I have analyzed these perceptions from an anthropological perspective combining elements of the Anthropological Theory of Didactics, developed in mathematics education, with a framework for the study of institutions - the Institutional Analysis and Development framework - developed in political science. The analysis of these perceptions is based on empirical data: final examinations from the past six years (2001-2007), used in the studied College institution, and specially designed interviews with 28 students. While a model of the instructors' perceptions could be formulated mostly in mathematical terms,\na model of the students' perceptions had to include an eclectic mixture of mathematical, social, cognitive and didactic norms. The analysis that I carry out shows that these students' perceptions have their source in the institutional emphasis on routine tasks and on the norms that regulate the institutional practices. Finally, I describe students' thinking about various tasks on limits from the perspective of Vygotsky's theory of concept development. Based on the 28 interviews that I have carried out, I will discuss the role of institutional practices on students' conceptual development.\nBack to top\n"}

Students with teaching assistantships are assigned duties each semester, such as marking and/or tutoring and/or teaching, which presupposes fluency in English.  Students with a research assistantship are given financial support from their supervisor in order to work on a specific research topic or thesis.  Applications for admissions in September, as well as for internal scholarships or financial support (TA) from the Department must be complete by February 1st. Financial support is available for PhD or MA/MSc (thesis option only) and is either through one of our internal scholarships, for competition winners, or from the Department through TA work. We do not offer January entry nor financial support during qualifying studies.\nISM/CRM\nThe Department is part of the Institut des sciences mathématiques ( ISM ), a unique centre of excellence for graduate training in Mathematics, combining the resources and expertise of the mathematics departments at the four Montreal-area universities, as well as Université de Sherbrooke and Université Laval.  The Department is also associated with the Centre de recherches mathématiques (CRM), a NSERC National Research Centre whose mission is to provide leadership in the development of mathematical sciences in Canada.  The Department has close collaboration with Computer Science, as well as other departments and universities, which means that students can often engage in interdisciplinary research.  A wide range of research seminars and lectures are held regularly, many of them being organized in conjunction with other Montreal universities, the ISM and the CRM.\nFacilities & services\nThe Concordia University Library subscribes to more than 80 mathematics and statistics journals and has reciprocal lending arrangements with the other three universities in Montreal.  The University's Computer Centre offers excellent computing facilities on both campuses, through its research computers with their extensive software support.  Additionally, the Department itself has a variety of personal computers and workstations, connected via ethernet and supporting a wide range of mathematical and text-editing software.  Most full-time graduate students are provided with office space inside the Department.  The common rooms are shared by faculty and students to facilitate academic and social contact. \nConcordia University, one of the two English-language universities in Montreal, is located on two campuses:  the Sir George Williams campus in downtown Montreal, and the Loyola campus in the west end of the city.  The Department of Mathematics and Statistics is based on the Sir George Williams downton campus, on the 9th floor of the Library building.\nMontreal is home to four universities and has a rich and cosmopolitan cultural life; virtually every international community is represented here. Concordia graduate students come from every part of the world, making for an enriching international work environment.  Montreal is noted for its dynamic cultural life, its wide selection of sporting and recreational activities, safe environment, attractive residential neighbourhoods and a lively atmosphere.  It is in close proximity to many other major centres in Canada and the U.S., as well as attractive vacationing areas.\n"}

It impacts our lives and the way we do things, and our researchers  are contributing to these developments” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.\n“The patents that Concordia’s innovators have been awarded are the result of years of work, and dedication to the idea of taking research results an extra step and improving a process or a product.”\nFrom inception to commercialization\nMaria Amer , an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was honoured for a noise reduction technology she and her students developed. It improves brightness and colour information in digital images without blurring their details.\nAmer’s new video processing technology is now commercially available through a license deal with wrnch Inc., a company backed up Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban. The video denoising technology was later licensed to Red Giant, an American filmmaking and motion graphics company.\nAmer says her research is driven by the need to innovate, and that commercialization is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n“You cannot fully plan where you go as a researcher,” she adds.\n“I started with a technology in 2009, but it turned out not to be powerful enough against industrial denoisers competition. I felt the challenge to outperform what was currently available on the market, so I asked one of my PhD students to work on this and he excelled.”\nAmer is now working on video object tracking methods. Her goal is to fundamentally advance new technology and scientific knowledge in this area, but if she finds an industry niche, she and her team may turn their attention to applied research.\n \nMaria Amer's video denoising technology has been licensed to Red Giant , an American filmmaking and motion graphics company. | Image courtesy of Pond5 via Red Giant\nInnovating to meet society’s challenges\nEverything from online auction interfaces to self-sealing building materials have been developed at Concordia.\nHere are descriptions of other recently patented inventions:\nBetter braking and steering\nWaizuddin Ahmed , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, specializes in system dynamics and design for road and railway vehicles.\nHe holds a patent on an independently controlled active steering system that not only enhances handling but also improves braking-in-a-turn performance of road vehicles. The independent control is further realized using a fail-safe mechanism and has potential for numerous other applications in active chassis control technology.\nNew dimensions in data\nArmen Atoyan , a senior lecturer of mathematics and statistics in the Faculty of Arts and Science, holds a patent for a new method of record-fast interpolation of data points within a multi-dimensional dataset.\nHis invention is of particular interest for application in the area of digital image processing, including both still and real-time images.\nPurpose-built nanoparticles\nJohn Capobianco , professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, is a specialist in the synthesis, characterization and spectroscopy of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.\nHis patented technology, in part, upconverts nanoparticles’ near-infrared light into the UV, visible and red regions. The results of this research, conducted in collaboration with students and other associates, have attracted considerable attention due their potential biomedical applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.\nSmart sensors for surgery\nJavad Dargahi , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is one of Canada’s leading experts in the application of haptic feedback systems\nIn his work with research associate Saeed Sokhanvar, he developed a patented smart tactile sensor and force and softness haptic feedback systems for robotic applications. His research could be implemented in hospitals offering minimally invasive, endoscopic surgeries.\nStronger, self-healing composites\nSuong Van Hoa , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has had marked success in obtaining patents for new inventions.\nOne area of his research focuses on the detection of defects in composite structures, such as airplanes, automobiles and wind turbines, to ensure that they are safe. His patents include an electrically conductive adhesive sheet for joining structural elements, a self-healing composite material designed to repair cracks and a system for making high-performance epoxies with clay particles.\nNew market mechanisms\nGregory Kersten , a professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, focuses on auctions and negotiations management\nHe developed an innovative market mechanism for procurement in computerized multi-attribute reverse auctions — a situation in which multiple sellers engage in a bidding process with a single buyer. Under Kersten’s mechanism, sellers are constrained to submit bids from admissible sets and the winner is selected by a pre-determined set of the buyer’s preferences that are unknown to the bidders.\nMiniature diagnostic tools\nMuthukumaran Packirisamy , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has been prolific in developing new technologies, having recently patented five new discoveries.\nPackirisamy is a specialist in biomedical microelectromechanical systems, or BioMEMS. Many of his inventions have to do with the miniaturization of photonic components for information technologies and diagnostic tools for health care to detect cancer and other illnesses that may be lurking in a person’s bloodstream. His latest work involves a power cell that harnesses electrical energy from the photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae.\nMore efficient heating systems\nGeorgios Vatistas , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, who has gained international renown for proving Nobel Prize-winner J.J. Thomson’s 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex rings, is an expert in research about how vortices can make energy exchange more economical.\nHis recently patented heat exchanger technology, which uses four to six times less energy to operate and is considerably smaller than a traditional shell-and-tube exchanger, and uses 40 times less energy to operate than the traditional plate heat exchanger, builds on his previous work in swirling water and air flows.\nFind out more about  resources for Concordia researchers .\nPresentations at Concordia's Technology and Innovation Recognition event were also made by some of the university's partners in innovation support, including Aligo Innovation, TandemLaunch and Fasken Martineau.\n \n"}

They stood beside posters bearing details about their work terms and what they had gained from their various on-the-job experiences.\nMegan Brown, who graduated from Concordia’s computer science program last fall, spent her final work term at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, where she developed an application for a remote-controlled car that can be operated using any Windows 10 device.\nBrown has accepted a job with the software behemoth, and she’s relocating to Washington in a few weeks.\nComputer engineering student Vincent Bilodeau spent his last work term at the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, optimizing audio effects and performing hardware performance profiling. “It’s pretty cool, you get to work on something, then play guitar, work on it a little more, then play some more guitar,” he said, smiling.\nBilodeau has a few courses left before he graduates, but he signed a contract for freelance work with Fender this summer, and he’s hopeful about his prospects for a future with the company.\nAccountancy student Nicholas Chin recently completed a work term at the professional services company KPMG where he helped corporate executives with their personal tax returns. He’s found his passion, he said. But before looking for his first job after he graduates this spring, he’s going to take some time off to travel. The ticket to Italy’s already booked. \n \nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi (far left) and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau (second from left) shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award.\nCo-op’s $8 million contribution\nHughes provided some figures to illustrate the program’s growth and diversity: Currently there are more than 40 Co-op programs at Concordia, including three new ones this year, in mathematical and computational finance , biology and aerospace engineering .\nClose to 1,800 students are enrolled as Co-op members, and they secured 1,400 work placements over the past year. On an annual basis, students in the program earn in the neighbourhood of $8 million. “This helps them with their education, but it also helps the local economy,” Hughes said.\nA vital bridge\nCatherine Bolton , Concordia’s vice-provost for teaching and learning, compared Co-op to a bridge, connecting the classroom to the workplace. “It results in an increase of possibilities — to communicate, to meet, to work together and to learn from each other,” she said. “This bridge partnership is vital to us, not only at the Co-op institute but also at Concordia.”\nBolton underlined the role Co-op’s experiential learning opportunities play in Concordia’s new strategic directions.\n“ Embrace the city, embrace the world speaks to the idea that Concordians can use their talents, expertise and energy to affect social change and to give back to the community that we live in, whether it's locally or globally,” Bolton said. “It is very clear that Co-op students and Co-op employers have long been helping us to achieve this goal.”\nCo-op’s ‘win-win’\nCo-op employer Angela D’Angelo, vice-president of training and client experience at National Bank Financial, highlighted the benefits of hiring Co-op students. “It’s win-win. It’s a two-way street,” she said. “You have no idea what these millennials can bring to your business, to your life and to your development.”\nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award .\nDe Masi said being a part of Co-op allowed her to face her fears and anxieties head on and develop the confidence needed to decide her career direction. “I've learned that it's important not to let people place you in a labelled box and tell you that that’s what you have to be in life,” she said. “I'll kick the box open and politely say, ‘No, thank you.’”\nBoudreau praised Co-op for allowing students to gain invaluable experience while working for employers who take a vested interest in developing their interns. “I really experienced this working on flight simulators and antennas for satellites. It was really remarkable to work with so many employers who would just listen, and be there when you needed help,” he said.\n“I learned to think a little less like a student and a little more like an engineer, and it reflected in the way that I came back to school.”\n"}

The professional web-based service connects businesses wishing to boost their online presence with high-quality freelancers that have the skills to make it happen.\nIt’s the brainchild of Liverani and husband Mikael Cho. The couple, ages 26 and 29, co-founded the company three years ago along with partners Luke Chesser and Angus Woodman.\nThe 1,000-square-metre ground-floor space of this historical building, which has retained the original tile, stone and brickwork, will also house a co-working space and café when it opens its doors in April 2016.\n“We have quite a lot of freelancers that are based in Montreal, and we had to get a new office space anyway,” Liverani says. “We figured, let’s have a physical presence and show what Crew looks like in the real world.”\nAs chief operating officer, Liverani helps define new product features, assures quality, sets up team processes, is responsible for hiring, and manages investor relations and the future of Crew.\nSince tripling its staff in 2014 — the company now employs upwards of 30 people — she admits that maintaining a good work-life balance is challenging.\n“There’s always something to do. It’s about finding that time where you can just think, maybe go for a walk,” says Liverani.\nFor her, this precious personal time is early in the morning when her Chow Chow dog begs to be taken out for a stroll.\nStaying on top of things takes a lot of self-discipline — a skill Liverani says she learned during her time at Concordia.\nA lifelong love of math led her to study actuarial mathematics in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. Motivated by the challenging and fast-paced nature of her studies, she was dismayed when her first job offered little more than a 9-to-5 grind in a tiny cubicle.\n“What I learned in school was very different than what happened when I graduated and went into the real world of working,” she says.\nDisillusioned, Liverani decided to make a career change after just one year in the actuarial field. Meanwhile, Cho — a designer — had grown tired of working in an agency and was ready to do something different.\nWith a $25,000 investment from FounderFuel — a Montreal-based startup accelerator that helps young entrepreneurs refine their vision into deliverable products — the couple co-founded Crew in 2012. Last year, the company raised more than $12 million.\n“In terms of learning how to start a business, it’s a lot of trial and error and listening to your gut,” Liverani says. “I think a lot of that stuff you can’t get in textbooks.”\n#CUalumni\n"}

The Simons Foundation division for Mathematics and Physical Sciences seeks to extend the frontiers of basic research. The Simons Fellows programs provide funds to faculty for up to a semester-long research leave from classroom teaching and administrative obligations, which can increase creativity and provide intellectual stimulation.\nAt the 2016 national meeting of the American Conference for Irish Studies, Gavin Foster ’s book, The Irish Civil War and Society: Politics, Class, and Conflict (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), was awarded the 2015 James S. Donnelly, Sr. Prize for Books on History and Social Sciences. The Donnelly Prize committee offered the following praise for the book: \"Foster is a perceptive and imaginative historian, who writes with verve and precision. Readers of this work will find that it has much to say that is new about social relations and hierarchy in Ireland in the 1920s.\" Foster is an associate professor in the School of Canadian Irish Studies.\nErica Lehrer, associate professor in the Department of History and Department of Sociology and Anthropology and Canada Research Chair in Post-Conflict Memory and Ethnography and Museology, was recently awarded a SSHRC Insight Grant valued at $133,268 for a four-year comparative project focusing on Poland and Canada, Difficult Heritage in National Museums.\nFor the second time in three years, MBA students from the John Molson School of Business have won the Whitman Case Competition, hosted by the Martin J.

This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.\n“This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,” said Roy. “I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.” \nThree of this year’s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success.\nDavid Tagliamonti\nBachelor of Science – Actuarial Mathematics\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nMake a reading/homework/study schedule in week one of your term and stick to it.\nPush yourself to ask \"why?\" This will deepen your understanding of course material.\nStay healthy. Regularly playing a sport or going to the gym will keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused in school.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nA problem often has many solutions. The science is in finding a solution; the art is in finding the best one.\nUniversity is a great time to learn from others — not just professors, but fellow students as well.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nKeep learning long after your formal education comes to an end.\nCristy Vista\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nListen earnestly to your professors when they give a lecture, and to your colleagues when they share their thoughts. Understanding others can widen our own perspective.\nDon't let confusion build up — it can hamper learning. Clarify concepts or processes you don't understand as soon as you hear about them.\nLearning should not be a lonely process. When you're having a hard time, ask for help. Concordia has many resources you can tap.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nInformation is never neutral. It must not be simply digested, but carefully examined and reflected on.\nThe world is built in a way that we are unequal and completely reliant on each other. The comforts we may have are at the expense of others, and this makes us our brother’s keeper.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nStudying to just get the grade can be tedious and off-putting. Relate your coursework to your passions, long-term goals and aspirations. This approach can give you encouragement during difficult times. \n \nBachelor of Arts – Linguistics\nThree keys to a good education:\nFirst off, it requires professors that not only teach what they love, but who teach you how to think critically and nurture high-quality ignorance. In other words, they teach you how to express your curiosity in meaningful and practical ways.\nA good education is one that helps you develop skills that will serve you throughout your entire life.\nFinally, it involves a network of people that constantly encourage and motivate you to thrive.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nThere are many resources in place to help us succeed at Concordia. We are fortunate to have advisors, committees and activities for everyone.\nI also learned to take classes from different departments. FAS has hundreds of different courses offered. This allows us to view the world from multiple perspectives.\nOne piece of advice to fellow students:\nBe resilient and passionate — the rest will follow!\n \n"}

That ability has certainly helped her in her career with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) LLP in Montreal.\n \nHer experience and expertise has also led Miriam to be named a recipient of the Women’s Executive Network’s (WXN) 2015 Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Awards. She was honoured at a gala hosted by the WXN at The Westin Montreal in April.\nMiriam Pozza is a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in Montreal and leads the Deals practice in Quebec. This year she celebrates a quarter-century with the company. | Photo credit: Claudia Landry\n“It’s always nice to have recognition when you put effort into your work, your personal development and the development of your team,” she says.\nAt Concordia, Pozza studied in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. “I was interested in anything that had to do with numbers and understanding our economy through numbers,” she says. “That’s what led me to the world of finance.”\nPozza joined the professional services network of PwC in 1991.\nShe says that her passion in assisting entrepreneurs and corporations in their growth has led her into the world of mergers and acquisitions.\nShe’s worked determinedly to distinguish herself in this competitive field.\n \nAfter spending several years in both the auditing and valuation departments — eventually receiving designations as a Chartered Professional Accountant and Chartered Business Valuator — Pozza became Deals leader for the Quebec Region in 2013.\n \nHer main function, she explains, is to help her colleagues work together towards the common goal of accompanying clients in their transactions. Aspects of the job that she finds particularly rewarding are the challenges of completing a deal, and helping companies grow to meet their full potential.\n \nPozza says her commitment to personal and professional development, coupled with her natural leadership qualities, has made her an important asset to the various organizations she has supported throughout her career.\n \n“If you view yourself as fortunate, and I do, I think giving back to the community is rewarding,” she says.\n \nFor 10 years, Pozza lent her accounting skills to the YWCA Montreal by acting as a treasurer on its board of directors. She also sits on the fundraising committee of La Fondation Armand-Frappier, a research institute in the life sciences sector.\n \n“Medicine and wellbeing were always something that I found of great interest,” she says, adding that her ambition was to become a doctor when she was younger.\n \nPozza also supports the advancement of women to leadership positions through her directorship with the Quebec Association of Women in Finance (AFFQ). In 2012, the AFFQ awarded her the Recognition Award for her tireless dedication.\n“I find it important to be part of this association and to specifically assist women in their development, by helping them build a network and develop their skills,” she says.\n \nDescribed previously by PwC CEO Bill McFarland as a natural mentor, Pozza believes strongly that building a network of mentors helps women develop their careers in the long run.\n \nThe best mentors, she says, will take an interest in your values and guide you out of your comfort zone. “Sometimes you need that little push to take some risks.”\n#CUalumni\n"}

This is an important new book, described as follows by Mark Thompson (University of East Anglia): ​\"By dint of phenomenal research, vivid reconstruction, and meticulous analysis, Max Bergholz uncovers the truth about interethnic killing in a Bosnian provincial town during 1941. At once dispassionate, spirited, and profoundly responsible, his inquiry proves the transformative power of extreme violence to create identity. This excellent and enlightening book deserves the widest readership.\"\nFor more information, including further testimonials and a link to the book's page on the Cornell University Press website, see the publisher's press release, please see below.\n \n \nCornell University Press is proud to announce the publication of Violence as a Generative Force, an in-depth look into a multi-ethnic community’s collapse into intercommunal killing during the summer of 1941, and the resulting transformation of its residents’ lives. The book’s findings have global implications for the study of mass violence and civil war, and will appeal to a wide variety of scholars, as well as to policy makers and NGO advocacy workers with interests in the possibilities and limits for preventing and/or stopping violence.\nFor more information about Violence as a Generative Force, see below and visit the book’s page on the Cornell University Press website:   http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100065060\nViolence as a Generative Force is also available as an ebook from Amazon/Kindle, Apple iBooks, Barnes & Noble/Nook, Google Play, and Kobo.\nAbout Violence as a Generative Force\nDuring two terrifying days and nights in early September 1941, the lives of nearly two thousand men, women, and children were taken savagely by their neighbors in Kulen Vakuf, a small rural community straddling today's border between northwest Bosnia and Croatia. This frenzy—in which victims were butchered with farm tools, drowned in rivers, and thrown into deep vertical caves—was the culmination of a chain of local massacres that began earlier in the summer. In Violence as a Generative Force, Max Bergholz tells the story of the sudden and perplexing descent of this once peaceful multiethnic community into extreme violence. This deeply researched microhistory provides provocative insights to questions of global significance: What causes intercommunal violence? How does such violence between neighbors affect their identities and relations?\nContrary to a widely held view that sees nationalism leading to violence, Bergholz reveals how the upheavals wrought by local killing actually created dramatically new perceptions of ethnicity—of oneself, supposed \"brothers,\" and those perceived as \"others.\" As a consequence, the violence forged new communities, new forms and configurations of power, and new practices of nationalism. The history of this community was marked by an unexpected explosion of locally executed violence by the few, which functioned as a generative force in transforming the identities, relations, and lives of the many. The story of this largely unknown Balkan community in 1941 provides a powerful means through which to rethink fundamental assumptions about the interrelationships among ethnicity, nationalism, and violence, both during World War II and more broadly throughout the world.\nAbout the Author\nMax Bergholz is Associate Professor of History at Concordia University in Montreal, where he holds the James M. Stanford Professorship in Genocide and Human Rights Studies. \nPraise for Violence as a Generative Force\n\"Violence as a Generative Force is a beautifully written, insightful, theoretically driven, compelling book. Max Bergholz is a gifted storyteller who lures the reader into a deeply complex story of multisided civil conflict, one that challenges presumptions about the processes and motives of violence.\"—Emily Greble, City College of New York, author of Sarajevo, 1941–1945: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Hitler's Europe\n\"Violence as a Generative Force sheds light on ethnic violence in original and illuminating ways. This remarkable book takes the gripping events in a small and often overlooked Bosnian community and places them in a startling new analytical perspective.\"—Edin Hajdarpasic, Loyola University Chicago, author of Whose Bosnia? Nationalism and Political Imagination in the Balkans, 1840–1914\n\"Violence in the Balkans has been overdescribed and underexplained. By dint of phenomenal research, vivid reconstruction, and meticulous analysis, Max Bergholz uncovers the truth about interethnic killing in a Bosnian provincial town during 1941. At once dispassionate, spirited, and profoundly responsible, his inquiry proves the transformative power of extreme violence to create identity. This excellent and enlightening book deserves the widest readership.\"—Mark Thompson, University of East Anglia, author of Birth Certificate and A Paper House\n\"Max Bergholz's Violence as a Generative Force is meticulously researched, engagingly written, and discerning in its judgments. It offers important new insights into the intercommunal violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina during World War II, but even more importantly it makes a significant contribution to the study of the dynamics of mass violence and how violence shapes identity and social relations in multiethnic societies. It should appeal to a wide multidisciplinary audience.\"—Mark Biondich, Institute of European, Russian and Eurasian Studies, Carleton University, author of The Balkans \n\"Violence as a Generative Force is a rare and challenging piece of scholarship: an ethnography of the past that shows how humans' darkest capabilities can also produce new forms of social solidarity. Max Bergholz asks very big questions about very small places, which is precisely the way to understand that most awful of social phenomena: the decision by one set of neighbors to throw another set down a cave.\"—Charles King, Georgetown University, author of Odessa and Midnight at the Pera Palace\n\"In this meticulously researched book, based on extensive archival work, Max Bergholz holds a microscope to a largely forgotten episode of violence in 1940s Bosnia. Informed by scholarship that spans multiple disciplines and regions, Bergholz's powerful analysis shows how violence shapes ethnicity—and in varied ways. While deeply anchored in Bosnia, this book has far-reaching implications for scholars of violence, social identity, and rural politics.\"—Scott Straus, University of Wisconsin–Madison, author of Making and Unmaking Nations  \nJoin the conversation\n"}

Published by the Azrieli Foundation as The Vale of Tears, translated by Vivian Felsen, Hirschprung’s memoir is a moving account of his escape from Nazi persecution. Rabbi Hirschprung’s memoir evokes a moment of transition in the history of the North American Jewish community when the magnitude of the ongoing Nazi destruction of European Jewry was becoming known but was still shrouded in the fog of war, and when the North American Jewish community was beginning to understand the immense challenges it faced.\nThe symposium will examine three major aspects of the life of the Montreal and, more generally, the North American Jewish community in 1944. Subjects to be examined include Orthodox Judaism, Yiddish culture and the Yiddish press, and the attitude of the North American Jewish community toward refugees from Nazi persecution. The symposium will\nconclude with the official book launch of The Vale of Tears.\nOrganizers: The Azrieli Foundation’s Holocaust Survivor Memoirs Program, Concordia\nUniversity’s Institute for Canadian Jewish Studies and the Montreal Holocaust Memorial\nCentre.\n"}

As a statistician, your understanding of probability theory lets you make decisions in the face of uncertainty. Statisticians also conduct surveys, analyze data, devise new methods of analysis and give advice on the statistical results of experiments such as clinical trials. Though it’s impossible to predict the future with 100 per cent accuracy, studying statistics will teach you creative problem solving, abstract thinking and analytical skills.\nWhen you study statistics, you learn to uncover the mathematical structure of random systems such as the economy, health and survival, the weather, and the stock market. You will also receive a solid foundation in linear algebra, calculus, probability and computational methods and learn to use professional software tools for mathematics and data analysis applications.\nAn undergraduate degree in statistics prepares students for graduate work in statistics or in a professional career in business, industry, medical research or government agencies.\nProgram Details\nA Bachelor of Arts or Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background .\nConcentrations:\nHonours in Statistics (66 credits)*\nSpecialization in Statistics (60 credits)\n*Admission is to the Specialization. Students in the specialization program seeking admission to the honours program may apply to the departmental honours advisor – normally following the completion of 30 credits.\n"}

It impacts our lives and the way we do things, and our researchers  are contributing to these developments” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.\n“The patents that Concordia’s innovators have been awarded are the result of years of work, and dedication to the idea of taking research results an extra step and improving a process or a product.”\nFrom inception to commercialization\nMaria Amer , an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was honoured for a noise reduction technology she and her students developed. It improves brightness and colour information in digital images without blurring their details.\nAmer’s new video processing technology is now commercially available through a license deal with wrnch Inc., a company backed up Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban. The video denoising technology was later licensed to Red Giant, an American filmmaking and motion graphics company.\nAmer says her research is driven by the need to innovate, and that commercialization is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n“You cannot fully plan where you go as a researcher,” she adds.\n“I started with a technology in 2009, but it turned out not to be powerful enough against industrial denoisers competition. I felt the challenge to outperform what was currently available on the market, so I asked one of my PhD students to work on this and he excelled.”\nAmer is now working on video object tracking methods. Her goal is to fundamentally advance new technology and scientific knowledge in this area, but if she finds an industry niche, she and her team may turn their attention to applied research.\n \nMaria Amer's video denoising technology has been licensed to Red Giant , an American filmmaking and motion graphics company. | Image courtesy of Pond5 via Red Giant\nInnovating to meet society’s challenges\nEverything from online auction interfaces to self-sealing building materials have been developed at Concordia.\nHere are descriptions of other recently patented inventions:\nBetter braking and steering\nWaizuddin Ahmed , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, specializes in system dynamics and design for road and railway vehicles.\nHe holds a patent on an independently controlled active steering system that not only enhances handling but also improves braking-in-a-turn performance of road vehicles. The independent control is further realized using a fail-safe mechanism and has potential for numerous other applications in active chassis control technology.\nNew dimensions in data\nArmen Atoyan , a senior lecturer of mathematics and statistics in the Faculty of Arts and Science, holds a patent for a new method of record-fast interpolation of data points within a multi-dimensional dataset.\nHis invention is of particular interest for application in the area of digital image processing, including both still and real-time images.\nPurpose-built nanoparticles\nJohn Capobianco , professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, is a specialist in the synthesis, characterization and spectroscopy of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.\nHis patented technology, in part, upconverts nanoparticles’ near-infrared light into the UV, visible and red regions. The results of this research, conducted in collaboration with students and other associates, have attracted considerable attention due their potential biomedical applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.\nSmart sensors for surgery\nJavad Dargahi , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is one of Canada’s leading experts in the application of haptic feedback systems\nIn his work with research associate Saeed Sokhanvar, he developed a patented smart tactile sensor and force and softness haptic feedback systems for robotic applications. His research could be implemented in hospitals offering minimally invasive, endoscopic surgeries.\nStronger, self-healing composites\nSuong Van Hoa , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has had marked success in obtaining patents for new inventions.\nOne area of his research focuses on the detection of defects in composite structures, such as airplanes, automobiles and wind turbines, to ensure that they are safe. His patents include an electrically conductive adhesive sheet for joining structural elements, a self-healing composite material designed to repair cracks and a system for making high-performance epoxies with clay particles.\nNew market mechanisms\nGregory Kersten , a professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, focuses on auctions and negotiations management\nHe developed an innovative market mechanism for procurement in computerized multi-attribute reverse auctions — a situation in which multiple sellers engage in a bidding process with a single buyer. Under Kersten’s mechanism, sellers are constrained to submit bids from admissible sets and the winner is selected by a pre-determined set of the buyer’s preferences that are unknown to the bidders.\nMiniature diagnostic tools\nMuthukumaran Packirisamy , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has been prolific in developing new technologies, having recently patented five new discoveries.\nPackirisamy is a specialist in biomedical microelectromechanical systems, or BioMEMS. Many of his inventions have to do with the miniaturization of photonic components for information technologies and diagnostic tools for health care to detect cancer and other illnesses that may be lurking in a person’s bloodstream. His latest work involves a power cell that harnesses electrical energy from the photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae.\nMore efficient heating systems\nGeorgios Vatistas , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, who has gained international renown for proving Nobel Prize-winner J.J. Thomson’s 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex rings, is an expert in research about how vortices can make energy exchange more economical.\nHis recently patented heat exchanger technology, which uses four to six times less energy to operate and is considerably smaller than a traditional shell-and-tube exchanger, and uses 40 times less energy to operate than the traditional plate heat exchanger, builds on his previous work in swirling water and air flows.\nFind out more about  resources for Concordia researchers .\nPresentations at Concordia's Technology and Innovation Recognition event were also made by some of the university's partners in innovation support, including Aligo Innovation, TandemLaunch and Fasken Martineau.\n \n"}

This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.\n“This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,” said Roy. “I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.” \nThree of this year’s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success.\nDavid Tagliamonti\nBachelor of Science – Actuarial Mathematics\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nMake a reading/homework/study schedule in week one of your term and stick to it.\nPush yourself to ask \"why?\" This will deepen your understanding of course material.\nStay healthy. Regularly playing a sport or going to the gym will keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused in school.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nA problem often has many solutions. The science is in finding a solution; the art is in finding the best one.\nUniversity is a great time to learn from others — not just professors, but fellow students as well.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nKeep learning long after your formal education comes to an end.\nCristy Vista\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nListen earnestly to your professors when they give a lecture, and to your colleagues when they share their thoughts. Understanding others can widen our own perspective.\nDon't let confusion build up — it can hamper learning. Clarify concepts or processes you don't understand as soon as you hear about them.\nLearning should not be a lonely process. When you're having a hard time, ask for help. Concordia has many resources you can tap.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nInformation is never neutral. It must not be simply digested, but carefully examined and reflected on.\nThe world is built in a way that we are unequal and completely reliant on each other. The comforts we may have are at the expense of others, and this makes us our brother’s keeper.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nStudying to just get the grade can be tedious and off-putting. Relate your coursework to your passions, long-term goals and aspirations. This approach can give you encouragement during difficult times. \n \nBachelor of Arts – Linguistics\nThree keys to a good education:\nFirst off, it requires professors that not only teach what they love, but who teach you how to think critically and nurture high-quality ignorance.

That ability has certainly helped her in her career with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) LLP in Montreal.\n \nHer experience and expertise has also led Miriam to be named a recipient of the Women’s Executive Network’s (WXN) 2015 Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Awards. She was honoured at a gala hosted by the WXN at The Westin Montreal in April.\nMiriam Pozza is a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in Montreal and leads the Deals practice in Quebec. This year she celebrates a quarter-century with the company. | Photo credit: Claudia Landry\n“It’s always nice to have recognition when you put effort into your work, your personal development and the development of your team,” she says.\nAt Concordia, Pozza studied in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. “I was interested in anything that had to do with numbers and understanding our economy through numbers,” she says. “That’s what led me to the world of finance.”\nPozza joined the professional services network of PwC in 1991.\nShe says that her passion in assisting entrepreneurs and corporations in their growth has led her into the world of mergers and acquisitions.\nShe’s worked determinedly to distinguish herself in this competitive field.\n \nAfter spending several years in both the auditing and valuation departments — eventually receiving designations as a Chartered Professional Accountant and Chartered Business Valuator — Pozza became Deals leader for the Quebec Region in 2013.\n \nHer main function, she explains, is to help her colleagues work together towards the common goal of accompanying clients in their transactions. Aspects of the job that she finds particularly rewarding are the challenges of completing a deal, and helping companies grow to meet their full potential.\n \nPozza says her commitment to personal and professional development, coupled with her natural leadership qualities, has made her an important asset to the various organizations she has supported throughout her career.\n \n“If you view yourself as fortunate, and I do, I think giving back to the community is rewarding,” she says.\n \nFor 10 years, Pozza lent her accounting skills to the YWCA Montreal by acting as a treasurer on its board of directors. She also sits on the fundraising committee of La Fondation Armand-Frappier, a research institute in the life sciences sector.\n \n“Medicine and wellbeing were always something that I found of great interest,” she says, adding that her ambition was to become a doctor when she was younger.\n \nPozza also supports the advancement of women to leadership positions through her directorship with the Quebec Association of Women in Finance (AFFQ). In 2012, the AFFQ awarded her the Recognition Award for her tireless dedication.\n“I find it important to be part of this association and to specifically assist women in their development, by helping them build a network and develop their skills,” she says.\n \nDescribed previously by PwC CEO Bill McFarland as a natural mentor, Pozza believes strongly that building a network of mentors helps women develop their careers in the long run.\n \nThe best mentors, she says, will take an interest in your values and guide you out of your comfort zone. “Sometimes you need that little push to take some risks.”\n#CUalumni\n"}

They stood beside posters bearing details about their work terms and what they had gained from their various on-the-job experiences.\nMegan Brown, who graduated from Concordia’s computer science program last fall, spent her final work term at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, where she developed an application for a remote-controlled car that can be operated using any Windows 10 device.\nBrown has accepted a job with the software behemoth, and she’s relocating to Washington in a few weeks.\nComputer engineering student Vincent Bilodeau spent his last work term at the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, optimizing audio effects and performing hardware performance profiling. “It’s pretty cool, you get to work on something, then play guitar, work on it a little more, then play some more guitar,” he said, smiling.\nBilodeau has a few courses left before he graduates, but he signed a contract for freelance work with Fender this summer, and he’s hopeful about his prospects for a future with the company.\nAccountancy student Nicholas Chin recently completed a work term at the professional services company KPMG where he helped corporate executives with their personal tax returns. He’s found his passion, he said. But before looking for his first job after he graduates this spring, he’s going to take some time off to travel. The ticket to Italy’s already booked. \n \nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi (far left) and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau (second from left) shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award.\nCo-op’s $8 million contribution\nHughes provided some figures to illustrate the program’s growth and diversity: Currently there are more than 40 Co-op programs at Concordia, including three new ones this year, in mathematical and computational finance , biology and aerospace engineering .\nClose to 1,800 students are enrolled as Co-op members, and they secured 1,400 work placements over the past year. On an annual basis, students in the program earn in the neighbourhood of $8 million. “This helps them with their education, but it also helps the local economy,” Hughes said.\nA vital bridge\nCatherine Bolton , Concordia’s vice-provost for teaching and learning, compared Co-op to a bridge, connecting the classroom to the workplace. “It results in an increase of possibilities — to communicate, to meet, to work together and to learn from each other,” she said. “This bridge partnership is vital to us, not only at the Co-op institute but also at Concordia.”\nBolton underlined the role Co-op’s experiential learning opportunities play in Concordia’s new strategic directions.\n“ Embrace the city, embrace the world speaks to the idea that Concordians can use their talents, expertise and energy to affect social change and to give back to the community that we live in, whether it's locally or globally,” Bolton said. “It is very clear that Co-op students and Co-op employers have long been helping us to achieve this goal.”\nCo-op’s ‘win-win’\nCo-op employer Angela D’Angelo, vice-president of training and client experience at National Bank Financial, highlighted the benefits of hiring Co-op students. “It’s win-win. It’s a two-way street,” she said. “You have no idea what these millennials can bring to your business, to your life and to your development.”\nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award .\nDe Masi said being a part of Co-op allowed her to face her fears and anxieties head on and develop the confidence needed to decide her career direction. “I've learned that it's important not to let people place you in a labelled box and tell you that that’s what you have to be in life,” she said. “I'll kick the box open and politely say, ‘No, thank you.’”\nBoudreau praised Co-op for allowing students to gain invaluable experience while working for employers who take a vested interest in developing their interns. “I really experienced this working on flight simulators and antennas for satellites. It was really remarkable to work with so many employers who would just listen, and be there when you needed help,” he said.\n“I learned to think a little less like a student and a little more like an engineer, and it reflected in the way that I came back to school.”\n"}

The professional web-based service connects businesses wishing to boost their online presence with high-quality freelancers that have the skills to make it happen.\nIt’s the brainchild of Liverani and husband Mikael Cho. The couple, ages 26 and 29, co-founded the company three years ago along with partners Luke Chesser and Angus Woodman.\nThe 1,000-square-metre ground-floor space of this historical building, which has retained the original tile, stone and brickwork, will also house a co-working space and café when it opens its doors in April 2016.\n“We have quite a lot of freelancers that are based in Montreal, and we had to get a new office space anyway,” Liverani says. “We figured, let’s have a physical presence and show what Crew looks like in the real world.”\nAs chief operating officer, Liverani helps define new product features, assures quality, sets up team processes, is responsible for hiring, and manages investor relations and the future of Crew.\nSince tripling its staff in 2014 — the company now employs upwards of 30 people — she admits that maintaining a good work-life balance is challenging.\n“There’s always something to do. It’s about finding that time where you can just think, maybe go for a walk,” says Liverani.\nFor her, this precious personal time is early in the morning when her Chow Chow dog begs to be taken out for a stroll.\nStaying on top of things takes a lot of self-discipline — a skill Liverani says she learned during her time at Concordia.\nA lifelong love of math led her to study actuarial mathematics in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. Motivated by the challenging and fast-paced nature of her studies, she was dismayed when her first job offered little more than a 9-to-5 grind in a tiny cubicle.\n“What I learned in school was very different than what happened when I graduated and went into the real world of working,” she says.\nDisillusioned, Liverani decided to make a career change after just one year in the actuarial field. Meanwhile, Cho — a designer — had grown tired of working in an agency and was ready to do something different.\nWith a $25,000 investment from FounderFuel — a Montreal-based startup accelerator that helps young entrepreneurs refine their vision into deliverable products — the couple co-founded Crew in 2012. Last year, the company raised more than $12 million.\n“In terms of learning how to start a business, it’s a lot of trial and error and listening to your gut,” Liverani says. “I think a lot of that stuff you can’t get in textbooks.”\n#CUalumni\n"}

Latimer\nFour actuarial students from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are celebrating a big win: they recently took home $20,000 from the second annual 2016 Munich Re Cup .\nThe Munich Re Cup — named after the sponsor, a global reinsurance company — is a national actuarial case competition open to teams from the Society of Actuaries'   Centers of Actuarial Excellence . These are university and college actuarial programs that meet specific  requirements  related to degree, curriculum, graduate count, faculty composition, graduate quality and connection to industry and research.\n“Concordia is one of eight Centers of Actuarial Excellence across Canada, and 30 worldwide,” says José Garrido , graduate program director and the first actuarial professor hired by Concordia back in 1986. “We’re the only English co-operative education program in Quebec.”\n“Winning the cup proves that our program is focusing on the right things,” he says. “It was designed to provide students with an opportunity to develop and apply their analytical, presentation and problem-solving skills to a real-world business problem … And the $20,000 in prize money is pretty nice!”\nOn March 12, students David Tagliamonti, Jasmine Lemay-Dagenais, Roxanne Côté and Ryan D'Orazio represented Concordia in Toronto at Munich Re headquarters, where seven teams competed. Each team was given the same case to solve four weeks beforehand.\nThis year’s case was “Specialty Drugs: How Do You Manage the Risk?”\n“Some new drugs are super expensive per treatment,” explains D’Orazio, a third-year actuarial student and a member of the Institute for Co-operative Educatio n.\n“So, how do we handle so many high-cost claims? We proposed providing less coverage for small claims, in a tiered solution that provides peace of mind. In addition, we proposed the implementation of certain drug-cost management strategies to decrease spending for both specialty and traditional drugs. These elements work in harmony to form a solution that is economically sound for the client, affordable for plan sponsors and attractive for plan members.”\nEach team submitted a one-page executive summary, individual team member profiles and an electronic copy of their presentation.\n“Munich Re liked that our team focused on the plan member — the end user,” says Tagliamonti, a team member and Co-op student, who is graduating in December. “The experience confirmed my belief that I’m going to like a career as an actuary.”\nLemay-Dagenais concurs. “Our team had the chance to work on a highly relevant issue to the group benefits insurance industry,” she says.\n“Having each had different previous work experiences, all of us contributed differently to the project. It was definitely a rewarding experience, and we were able to obtain valuable feedback from the judging panel.” \nMost of the team members heard about the Munich Re Cup via the student newsletter produced by the Mathematics Actuarial Statistics Student Association (MASSA) .\n“To apply, we each wrote a one-page essay about why we wanted to compete, then we approached our program director, Patrice Gaillardetz ,” says D’Orazio. “I learned so much, like the importance of taking a strong business perspective and taking into account how all parties are affected.”\nCôté believes that one of the most valuable assets a student can have in her field is experience.\n“This is mainly why I registered for the Munich Re Cup in the first place, which turned out to be a very gratifying experience,” she says. “Not only have I learned about the reinsurance industry, but I also gained a lot of analytical skills, creativity and confidence.”\nThe burning question: what are the students going to do with their $5,000 prize money?\n“Invest it safely and wisely!” says Tagliamonti, with a laugh.\n"}

It’s not just, here’s a formula and use it,” explains Hyndman.\nThis Co-op program will follow a new model: rather than applying straight out of CEGEP, students will complete one term of courses at Concordia before being eligible for a Co-op schedule with three work terms.\n“We’re going to have students who have more program-specific knowledge when they do their first work term,” says Hyndman of the decision to structure the program differently.\nExamples of the fields of Co-op work available to students include finance, capital markets, investment banking, treasury, risk management and insurance.\n“This also allows us to present multiple Co-op options to an employer to make it that much more interesting to partner with us,” explains Gerry Hughes, director of the Institute for Co-operative Education. He’s quick to praise Hyndman’s and senior program coordinator Nadine Benjamin’s efforts to get this new option off the ground.\n“Cody is a very dynamic leader who is fully committed to our Co-op program,” Hughes says. “His total dedication is very much appreciated. All of these programs have become some of our top ‘flagship’ Co-op programs at Concordia.”\nDaniel Eklove, BA 13, says this Co-op option provides valuable networking opportunities for students that can translate into future employment offers. “One thing that I've noticed in the couple of years since graduating is that there's a big hole in the financial workforce just waiting to be filled by MACF graduates. But it's not an obvious hole. It's subtle.”\nEklove is speaking both as a student and a potential boss. “Now, as an employer, this program is a good opportunity to explore potential future talent while connecting with my alma mater,” he says.\nHyndman is looking forward to getting the show on the road. “I think this is going to be a very popular option with students, and one which will help them launch successful careers upon graduating.”\nBiology: ‘There is a need for qualified interns’\nBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the food industry, environmental testing firms, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, hospitals, universities — there are plenty of places that benefit from biology graduates’ scientific expertise.\nStarting this fall, undergraduates students enrolled in the Department of Biology at Concordia will be able to gain invaluable on-the-job experience during their studies thanks to the department’s new Co-op option.\n“There is a need in industry for qualified interns,” says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , a senior lecturer in the Department of Biology who spearheaded the creation of the biology Co-op program, one of only two in the province.\nShe says the opportunity to alternate work and study terms will likely attract more top-notch biology undergraduates to Concordia.\n“What students do outside of the regular curriculum is so important,” she says, “They have to have a good CV when they graduate, because when they start looking for a job, it's already too late.”\nLucia Plescia, coordinator at the Institute for Co-operative Education, says the plan is to grow the program sustainably, ensuring that Co-op students are set up with engaging and dynamic work opportunities.\nShe adds that students who do apply will be encouraged to be open to working anywhere in Quebec, Canada or even internationally. “This will enhance and diversify the quality of work terms as well as provide enriching life experiences,\" she says.\nGray-Mitsumune agrees that flexibility is key, pointing out the federal government’s need for qualified interns to carry out research in the field. “One example might be a station in Mont-Joli that hires undergraduate students for fish studies.”  \nTo be eligible for the biology Co-op program, students must be enrolled in a specialization or honours program and have a CRC (La cote de rendement au collégial) score of 28.00 or higher. However, even students who meet the requirements are not guaranteed admittance to the program.\nThose who want to find out more about the selection process are encouraged to contact the institute.\nThe biology Co-op option consists of six study terms and three work terms, completed consecutively over a three-year period, including summer terms.\n“We are always looking to increase the depth and breadth of experiential learning opportunities for students,” says Hughes.\n“We were delighted to provide the support to both departments in getting these programs up and running, and obviously we’re all excited to begin accepting the first cohort and preparing them for future academic and professional success.”\nFind out more about Concordia’s Institute for Co-operative Education .\n \n"}

A match was soon made with Aviva Canada, an insurance company that had worked with Mitacs and Concordia students in the past.\nAt Aviva, Nawar is using her research to help the company improve its decision making for insurance rates so it can manage costly claims — a process known as risk modelling. “The idea is to give Aviva a competitive advantage in this area by improving their overall accuracy in predicting claim severities and frequencies.”\nHer supervisor at Aviva, Charles Dugas — who also happens to be a former Mitacs participant — sees Nawar as vital to improving important processes the company depends upon to stay competitive.\n“It’s a fast-paced business and we don’t always have the time to develop and test new ideas,” he says.\n“Having a bright, hardworking student examining how we do our business is invaluable. Sandra is also a vital link for us when it comes to the newest trends in research and development that are being discussed in academia, something that can get lost in the daily grind of the business world.”\nFor students at all stages of research\nNawar’s graduate supervisor, Jose Garrido , a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics , is a huge proponent of the Mitacs program. To date, he has referred four students he has supervised.\n“For students who are in the early process of their research, a Mitacs internship can give them ideas as to how to further develop their work,” says Garrido. “For those in the later stages, it’s a chance to take their idea and run with it in a way that can benefit a company.”\nWhen it comes to Nawar, Garrido believes her success at Aviva is a direct result of her drive and personality. “Sandra is the type of student who can’t only live in theory, she needed to get her hands dirty and put her research to work. This kind of outlet and experience will give her a great advantage once she graduates.”\nIf you are a student or a supervisor interested in the variety of programs offered by Mitacs, contact Jean-Philippe Valois, director of Business Development, at jpvalois@mitacs.ca or 514-575-0425.\n \n"}

She spends Sunday mornings exploring logic problems, Dirichlet's principle and geometry, among other things.\nHosted by Concordia, in a joint project with l' Institut des sciences mathématiques (ISM) , the Montreal Math Circle is a self-funded, independent enrichment program for young students — grades three to eight — interested in solving math problems at their school level. After two successful pilot sessions last fall, a third held in January and the fourth will start on February 21 and run until March 13.\n“Math Circle breaks out of the traditional teacher-student model, with more informal collaboration and brainstorming,” Tsypin says.\nHow it works\nFacilitated by Alina Stancu , associate professor in Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics and ISM director, and run by PhD candidate Ildiko Pelczer, Math Circle divides students into three groups according to age and grade. On average, there are 10 kids per age group — half are girls, in the younger sections.\nThey work individually and collectively on the same problems during the 90-minute, Sunday morning sessions led by Pelczer.\n“There’s a need for this kind of thing in Montreal,” says Pelczer, who started doing four-hour mathematical Olympiads in Romania in grade seven. “It shows that math is creative and the students have the freedom to be inventive. And we work on the kind of contest questions that you don’t usually see in school.”\nFour-prong outreach\nMontreal Math Circle is just one of four math outreach initiatives by Concordia. Another is the Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest , a 20-year-old worldwide math competition that debuted in Canada in 2001. Anna Sierpinska , a Concordia professor who specializes in math education, initiated hosting the contest at Concordia in 2012. Since then, she has remained involved, and the contest’s hosting is organized by Pelczer and department administrator Jane Venettacci.\nThe registration deadline for the next Kangaroo contest is March 7, for the March 20 event. Over 200 students are expected.\n“Engaging the Montreal community in mathematics and statistics is important to us, whether hosting or participating in mathematical competitions for elementary to high-school children, or sponsoring mathematical competitions and student-related activities,” says Nadia Hardy , associate professor of mathematics and chair of the department.\n“We are dedicated to continuing our involvement, and finding new ways of increasing our outreach.”\nTournament of Towns\nConcordia’s third and newest outreach initiative is the international mathematics competition called Tournament of Towns . It’s a problem-solving contest for students up to the age of 18 that began in Russia in the late 1970s.\n“More than 120 cities participate, from more than 25 countries,” says Stancu. “The main goal of this tournament is to provide an opportunity for a large number of students to participate in a competition with worldwide standards. Some problems can be very challenging, yet they require creative use of simple tools rather than advanced mathematical knowledge.”\nThe next tournament is scheduled for February 28. It will be held on the Sir George Williams Campus. To register, email each student’s name and school grade to montrealmathclub@gmail.com by February 23.\nFormula of Unity\nThe fourth outreach initiative is the International Mathematical Olympiad Formula of Unity/The Third Millennium for students from grades six to 12. Organized by the Saint Petersburg State University and the Euler Foundation, it was first held in the 2013-14 academic year. During the 2014-15 edition, it gathered more than 6,000 students from 15 countries.\nIn Montreal, the tournament is facilitated by Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics and  l'Institut des sciences mathématiques (ISM). \nIt takes place in two rounds. The second round — which invites students who received the best results in the first round — will be held on February 21. \nExponential growth?\n“Right now, we are creating a vibrant math community, which is very important to all, and we hope to add to our activities a one or two-week summer camp,” says Stancu. “The challenge will be getting the right logistics support with things like payroll, legal issues, general administration. The enthusiasm from the kids is already there.”\nTo register your child for the next Montreal Math Circle session, which runs from February 21 until March 13, email  montrealmathclub@gmail.com , indicating your name, and the name and school grade of your child.\nThe next Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest takes place on March 20. Register your child by March 7.\nThe next Tournament of Towns contest is February 28. It will be held in Room MB-1.437, John Molson Building (MB), Sir George Williams Campus. The four-hour contest starts at 11:30 a.m. To register, email each student’s name and school grade to montrealmathclub@gmail.com by February 23.\n \n"}

Student Jason Azzoparde tells us", "text": "What's it really like to be CEO for a day? Student Jason Azzoparde tells us\nOn February 5, Concordia's national finalist shadowed the president of PSP Investments\nPosted on February 5, 2016\n|\nBy: Jason Azzoparde\nUndergraduate Jason Azzoparde, a student in Concordia's  Department of Mathematics and Statistics  and a member of the  Institute for Co-operative Education , was recently selected as one of 18 finalists in the annual CEO for a Day competition , run by executive search firm Odgers Berndtson. \nThe fourth-year student in actuarial mathematics and finance  spent yesterday, February 5, shadowing André Bourbonnais, president and CEO of PSP Investments .\nIt was an opportunity to network with top level executives and learn about their roles in the company. Here's Azzoparde's story about his day at the top of the corporate ladder. \nMorning meeting at PSP\nThe day began with a breakfast in André Bourbonnais's office. Daniel Garant, executive vice-president and chief investment officer (CIO), was also in attendance. This was an opportunity to introduce ourselves and speak about our interests in the financial markets. André and Daniel advised me on their current market outlook and where they see opportunities to tailor their global portfolio.   \nHuman resources and talent management takeaways\nThe next stop was Guy Archambault's office, senior vice-president of Human Resources and Talent Management. Guy explained how he built the human resources structure from when the company was at about 10 per cent of its current size. He also informed me about current headwinds he is facing in the fast-growing company.\nSonia Goyette, senior director of Talent Management also gave me a glimpse of her recruiting strategies for both experienced professionals and new graduates. The CEO even challenged me on a real human capital management case regarding relocation compensation. A CEO must constantly weigh the opportunities of reducing compensation costs while still minimizing the talent turnover rate. \n \nTense moments on the trading floor\nThis was by far the most exciting part of the day! I was given a quick summary of the public market trading activities, both on the equity and derivatives side. The trading operations of the institution are fast-paced and these analysts must perform market transactions in a very limited time frame. I even had the privilege of witnessing a real-life arbitrage strategy as the trader walked me through the transaction. I must admit that my heart rate was racing as we were approaching the execution of the deal!\nMore insights over lunch\nLunch was scheduled at Decca 77 with Anik Lanthier, senior vice-president of Public Equities and Absolute Return, Stephane Jalbert, managing director in Real Estate Investments, and Guthrie Stewart, senior vice-president and global head of Private Investments. I had the opportunity to learn more about their successful careers and certain challenges they faced along the way.\n$100-million deals and a leader with impressive poise \nThe afternoon began with an investment pitch from Hong Kong investors. I was able to meet the chairman and CEO of the fund and attentively analyze the deal proposal. These meetings are key to the success of PSP in developing a well-diversified portfolio. Not to mention, many deals are executed for way over $100 million!\nMr. Bourbonnais has a long-lasting relationship with many of his overseas business partners and observing him in action was impressive, to say the least. Finally, a presentation was conducted at the PSP office by a top Canadian bank. The CEO and other senior executive members were present to exchange business ideas. It was an intimidating, yet humbling feeling to be sitting alongside two distinguished Canadian CEOs.\nLooking back on my day, I can truly say that a CEO’s life has multiple dimensions to it. The culture a leader brings to a corporation is key to growth and sustainability. André is a well-rounded individual, one that cares for his people while demanding nothing short of excellence. A true leader by heart, André has demonstrated that the right mix of passion, vision and intelligence can go a long way toward building a successful career. \n \nRead about how Jason Azzoparde earned the Bourse Gilles Joncas in 2014 , given to the top co-op student in Quebec by the provincial branch of the Association canadienne de l’enseignement cooperative (ACDEC). \n \n"}

He is survived by his wife Fauzia Begum, their son Syed Furrokh-Nabeel Ali (Samira Karim), and grandson Syed Aydin Karim Ali.\nTwareque completed his doctoral studies in mathematical physics at the University of Rochester in1973.  After periods of research and teaching in ICTP Trieste, University of Toronto, UPEI, and ITP Clausthal, Germany, he joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Concordia University in 1981.  He was promoted to full professor here in 1990.\nTwareque pursued research in many areas of mathematics, mostly in analysis, functional analysis, and quantum mechanics.  He published his work with numerous scientists around the world in over 120 research articles and in a number of books. He was always studying and preparing lectures, now wavelets, now differential geometry, now group theory. His presentations were structured, lucid, interesting, deep, and, before the fashion of electronic displays, by means of perfectly clear handwriting on the blackboard. \nHe was not inclined to profess an overt teaching philosophy but an observer might infer that it was ‘empowerment through mathematical understanding’.  He was himself impressively erudite with an eclectic taste that included history, philosophy and literature, and the mastery of at least five European languages in addition to Bengali and Hindi, and some Farsi and Arabic.\nHe was extremely generous and engendered enormous affection in his students and colleagues. He had an amusing story or anecdote for almost every occasion – often related to other mathematicians he knew from his extensive travels – and had a repertoire of funny jokes that naturally prompted his distinctive laughter.\nHis inspiring presence and cheerful demeanor will be sorely missed by us all.\nTestimonials can be sent  here  for publication.\nMarch 17, 2016\nWith deep sorrow, I learned about the passing of Dr. Ali.\nTwareque was a very well known scientist, with important contributions in the field of Mathematics and Physics, but even more important he was an exceptional human being.\nI first met him in Havana, Cuba in the nineties. Had the honour to organize, jointly with him, the first workshop in Wavelets and Quantization Methods at the University of Havana. Thanks to his remarkable persistence, the event went on for almost two decades and left a fingerprint in the scientific community, not only in Cuba but in a wider Latin American context.    His leadership allowed for a durable and fruitful relationship between both Math departments at Concordia and Havana universities , along all these years.\nHe fell in love with the city of Havana and its people, and was consequent with this feeling over his entire life. There, he left behind numerous friends and colleagues, well aware of his limitless generosity, sense of solidarity and contagious laugh.\nPablo Olivares\nAssociate Professor, Department of Mathematics\nRyerson University\nFebruary 18, 2016\nThere is nothing not to like about Professor Ali.\nI first met him in Malaysia, during his first visit as an invited speaker to our Expository Quantum Lecture Series in 2007 (EQuaLS1) with the theme of Geometry, Number Theory and Quantum Physics 2007. He for sure was among the expert in the field of quantization theory. The event was organized by INSPEM, University Putra Malaysia. During his visit, I approached him discussing whether I can further my Ph.D under his supervision. He agreed and through his help and justification mentioning Montreal is among the best place to study mathematical physics, I managed to get a government scholarship starting early September 2008.\nDays in Montreal have never been so difficult for us. Despite being an expert in his field, he was so humble in nature. He has been very helpful with almost everything since the early day we arrived. His friends are all over and through him, my other half has had this opportunity to make contacts with the engineering department of Concordia and until now remain in good relationship. Our almost five years in Montreal have been so fruitful. Thanks to him.\nAfter I finished in 2014, we remained to be in good contacts and he has supported our EQuaLS series continuously. Therefore, his recent visit to Malaysia (EQuaLS8) was the most unforgettable memory since it didn't occur to me that it was going to be his last visit. He has contributed much to our institute, INSPEM through his ideas, suggestions and a lot more. Most of us here in Malaysia will never forget Prof. Ali and he has become part of our big 'family' here in the institute. Professor Ali will definitely be missed.\nMy deepest condolences, to his wife and family.\nNurisya Mohd Shah\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Physics\nUniversity Putra Malaysia\nFebruary 8, 2016\nI was postdoctoral fellow at CRM on October 1999.  I think it must have been early November, and an elegant sir apparently of Indian origin (I did not know at the time he was from Bangladesh) knocked at the ajar door of my office and introduced himself to me in Italian, with the typical regional accent of Trieste.\nThat was a surreal moment!\nOver the past 16 years he has been a continuous presence in personal and professional life; his then PhD student Anna, became my wife and Twareque was present at my wedding in Poland (and he danced too!)\nHis office is just two doors down the corridor: his endearing laughter still echoes in my ear when I sit in my office. His wide interests and education made his company fantastically pleasant and never obtrusive.\nI have very fond memories of Twareque, in particular those associated to the conferences we attended together, several times, in Bialowieza and Havana.\nHis untimely passing leaves all of us disconcerted.\nMy wife Anna, my Parents Daria and Pino and myself are deeply saddened by his passing and wish to extend our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel and his family.  \nMarco Bertola\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 3, 2016\nI knew Twareque since he began his career at Concordia.  He was special and unique in so many ways.  Academically, he was very well established as an expert in mathematical physics and had professional contacts literally in every corner of the world.  I don’t know anyone else who traveled as extensively as he did to give invited talks, or to participate in conferences, or official exchange programs between Concordia and other universities that were created through his initiative, such as the annual one between Concordia and the University of Havana and another one with the University of Bialystok, Poland.\nTwareque was one of the most broadly educated people I have known.  Besides his own areas of expertise in mathematical physics, he was familiar with philosophy, history, literature and poetry. He spoke six or seven languages, and was quite at home in most of the countries he visited. \nHe was an excellent teacher who also taught in the Science College from time to time and the students there greatly appreciated the way he introduced them to genuine mathematical thinking.  He had a terrific sense of humour and an endless supply of stories and anecdotes.  I chatted with him over a cup of coffee just a few days before he left for Malaysia and feel a very profound sense of loss.  We will all miss his stories, his laughter, his wisdom and his expertise.\nHal Proppe\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 2, 2016\nTwareque is one of the most outstanding men I have known. A man of great culture and modesty.\nI am friends with Twareque since 1998. I had the chance to meet him thanks to one of the many academic responsibilities he had, both within and outside the university, such as member of the Graduate Committee of the Mathematics and Statistics Department at Concordia University, 1999-2002; member of a special committee appointed by the Dean to study the future of the Department of Physics and that recommended measures to restructure it, 2000-2001; he was a member of the Organizing Committee of the XI to the XXVI Colloquia on Geometric Methods in Physics, developed in Bialowieza, Poland, from 1992 to 2007; Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of Montreal, 2003-2006; member of the Organizing Committee and founder of I to XVIII Workshops held in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Havana; he helped the development of international scientific cooperation between the University of Havana, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Center for International Academic Cooperation at Concordia University. In particular, Twareque's contribution to the scientific development of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer at University of Havana was outstanding, since 1998 when he began collaborating with the Faculty, encouraging the participation of its members in research and in the development of the research on Wavelets and its various applications, including in Physics.\nAnother of Twareque's contributions was the organization of an annual workshop of international importance to promote the participation of - and exchange with - young faculty members, which gave much added vitality to the event. Twareque showed a great capacity to help the University of Havana and in particular, the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, by donations of computer equipment for the Faculty and through his efforts in bringing international experts to exchange experiences with the Cuban mathematical community and to deliver specialized courses. In 2009, in recognition for his service and efforts, the University of Havana awarded Twareque the special title of Invited Professor.\nHe was a man of extreme human sensitivity. Special friend of my family. We regret the loss of a great friend and a great man of science. I wish to express my condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel.\nReinaldo Rodriguez\n"}

There were 21 people with 20 years of service, 46 with 25 years, 19 with 30 years, 27 with 35 years, 11 with 40 years, nine with 45 years, three with a remarkable 50 years, as well as 117 retirees.\nBenoit-Antoine Bacon , Concordia’s provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, congratulated staff and faculty for their dedicated service.\nHe joked about trying to “wrap his head around” the fact that some of those being honoured had worked at Concordia when the Beatles were new on the pop music scene.\n“Thank you to everyone who has built Concordia into the amazing place that it is today,” said Bacon. “Everyone’s unique contribution over the years has given us our character today.”\nJune S. Chaikelson, 50 years at Concordia. | All photos by Concordia University\nAlan Shepard , the university’s president, noted that  Manfred \"Fred\" Szabo  was celebrating his 51st year of service as a professor in the  Department of Mathematics and Statistics , while  June S. Chaikelson , a professor in the  Department of Psychology , and  Barry Frank , a professor in the  Department of Physics , were just one year behind, at 50 years of service.\n“After so many years the sense of bond we have with each other is strong,” said Shepard, before outlining Concordia’s  strategic directions .\n“Maybe we met a mate here, sent our children to university here, and made deep connections. Concordia is ultimately about people, not buildings … As retirees, you’re still ambassadors, so please continue to spread the word about Concordia and the new strategic directions that make us a next-generation university.”\nRepresenting the honourees, Eric Goldner, a manager of  Student Recruitment , took the microphone to discuss his experience growing up with a father who worked as a counsellor at Concordia.\nGoldner Jr. went on to contribute his own 25 years of service, and counting.\n“Now, as a student recruiter, when I tell prospective students and their parents about our long-term service, it resonates well,” said Goldner, who has held seven jobs in seven different departments across campus.\n“Each of us plays a part, and it wouldn’t be the same without your contribution and commitment to the evolution of Concordia.”\nPeter Shizgal, 40 years at Concordia. \"It's gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.\"\nCheryl Williams, a retired department assistant from the  Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema , was among the honourees. Over the years, she has enjoyed following the careers of graduates, including feature film director Christian Duguay and animator Chris Hinton.\n“Sometimes, it felt like I had 300 kids,” laughed Williams, who served for 30 years.\n“The animators and film studies students are quiet, while the film production students are more outgoing. I’ll miss them all.”\nAnother honouree, Peter Shizgal , a professor of psychology, is celebrating 40 years of service. Like Williams, he enjoys the collegial nature of his department.\n“The department was on the rise when I started, and my area — behavioural neurobiology — really took off,” he said. “It’s gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.”\nShizgal has no plans to retire. He will continue to focus his research on reward and decision making. “I have a grant that doesn’t run out until 2018, and I’ve applied to renew a grant that I’ve had since 1976. It would provide funding until 2021.”\nVenkat Ramachandran, 45 years at Concordia. \"I'm proud to have been a part of that.\"\nVenkat Ramachandran , a professor from the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , is celebrating 45 years at Concordia. His son followed his footsteps, studying electrical engineering at Concordia, and now teaches at Rowan University in New Jersey.\n“The department expanded and made a name for itself,” said Ramachandran, who has 21 academic awards in research, teaching, administration and engineering education.\n“I’m proud to have been a part of that.”\nRead more about  Concordia staff who were honoured  in 2015.\n \n"}

She was 19 years old.\n“My colleagues were approaching me to give me work and I wondered why they were not addressing me by my name, Alfonsina,” recounts Plenzich. “I soon figured out that, like in my childhood, they were having a hard time pronouncing my name. So I said, ‘By the way, you can call me Alfie.’”\nAlfie Plenzich\nPlenzich — who still goes by Alfie — says their reaction was one of relief. She says her years at Concordia have been full of funny stories, friendships and learning.\n“You know when you're a child and you’re growing up, and your mother and father teach you? Well, Concordia became that to me,” says Plenzich. “I was a child from an immigrant family. In my area, I was surrounded by Italian people. When I came here it was all kinds of people. The best part was the knowledge, the surroundings and my co-workers, some of whom are now part of my life.”\nOne of those people is her husband, Alan Gingell, who works in the Mail Services division of Facilities Management. They met in 1992 at a university event.\nDuring her four decades at Concordia, Plenzich has worked for Financial Services , which handled payroll before it came under the umbrella of Human Resources , as well as for the Faculty of Arts and Science as a budget officer. \nToday, she is a payroll administrator with Human Resources. For the calendar year Plenzich works on income taxes, and for the fiscal year, balance-sheet accounts. She also serves as a resource person for her colleagues and the university community.\nOver the years, Plenzich has experienced first-hand the integration of new technologies and watched the university transform.\n“Everything we did was by hand. Then one day they decided they were going to put this foreign thing on my desk called a computer,” says Plenzich with a laugh. “Now I cannot live without a computer, iPad or iPhone.”\nPlenzich says her career at Concordia has allowed her to grow, learn and become the person she is today.\n“I still enjoy my job and I love Concordia.”\nFred Szabo: steadfast teacher and former dean\nProfessor of Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics\n50 years at Concordia\nFred Szabo started his teaching career at Sir George Williams University in the fall of 1964.\nOver half a century later, Szabo is a full professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\n“Concordia allowed me to fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher,” says Szabo, who specializes in the computer-assisted teaching of mathematics.\nFred Szabo\nIn 1986, Szabo took on the role of dean of Graduate Studies, and supervised the establishment of many new graduate degrees, including the PhD in Biology, PhD in Mathematics, MSc in Administration and MSc in Aerospace Engineering.\n“I fought tooth and nail for Concordia to create graduate programs at a time when this was really a big deal,” says Szabo. “These things are now taken for granted. In the late ’80s they required finesse, tact and inspiring collaboration.”\nAfter Szabo's term, the Senate approved the establishment of a School of Graduate Studies.\nIn ’92 Szabo hung up his dean’s hat and went back to teaching, which has kept him busy for the last 22 years. During this time, he pioneered online mathematics education.\n“One of the gratifying aspects of my 51 years of teaching at Concordia is the fact that some colleagues still often greet me as ‘Dean Szabo.’”\n“I must have done something right,” he adds.\nA lasting tribute to Szabo’s work, inspiration and vision is his brainchild, the Prix d’excellence of the Association des doyens des études supérieures au Québec (ADESAQ), which recognizes the best PhD thesis written at one of the four universities in Montreal in a given year.\n“There is always lots of work to be done and lots of opportunities to do it. Where others see obstacles, I see opportunities.”\nThe Long Service and Retirees Luncheon takes place today, December 10, 2015.\n \n"}

What makes the contest special, Pelczer says, is that it's accessible to all young students, regardless of their mathematical abilities. \n\"The problems are designed with different levels of difficulty, so everybody can do something. And even though it's not far from the school curriculum, the problems are still formulated in an interesting way, so it's not just plain calculation.\"\nAs Sierpinska points out, the competition is particularly popular among students in elementary school.\n\"The young children have fun with math, that's it. They have friends there, and they just come and enjoy themselves — playing with children who have the same kinds of interests as they have, thinking about a problem and twisting it around.\"\nStudents who return tend to do better, Pelczer says. \"They come back and they're stronger, so we have better results every year at the national level, not just at the local level.\"\nThere's even a component of the contest for parents who've come to cheer on their children, so they can flex their perhaps long-dormant math muscles.\n\"It's a compilation of problems to give them a feeling of what it's about,\" Pelczer says. \nAs asssociate professor  Nadia Hardy  explains, engaging the Montreal community is important to Department of Mathematics and Statistics .\n\"Whether it's hosting or participating in mathematical competitions for elementary to high school children, or sponsoring mathematical competitions and student-related activities, we are dedicated to continuing our involvement, and finding new ways of increasing our outreach.”\nFind out more about the  2016 Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest  at Concordia.\n \n"}

If current trends continue, that number will increase to 70 million by 2025, according to the World Heath Organization .\nIt’s not just genes that are the cause: socio-demographic and environmental elements are also contributing factors. Lower socio-economic status, living in neighbourhoods that aren’t walkable and poor access to fresh fruits and vegetables can all increase the risk of being overweight.\nWith obesity rates on the rise, a team of Montreal-based researchers embarked on a study to find out how parenting styles and the broader social environment combine to affect children's obesity risk.\n“We thought that certain types of parenting would be associated with a higher risk of childhood obesity, and that the strength of this association would differ between children living in poverty and those who aren’t,” says Lisa Kakinami , the study’s lead author and an assistant professor in Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics in collaboration with the PERFORM Centre.\nThe study, published in Preventive Medicine, suggests that both poverty and parenting style are important predictors of childhood health. “Successful strategies to combat childhood obesity need to reflect these independent and interactive associations on health,” Kakinami says.\nShe and her research team* used data from a national survey of Canadian youth, carried out by Statistics Canada from 1994 to 2008. They examined information on 37,577 children and compared socio-demographic and socio-economic status, family and neighbourhood characteristics, and height and weight.\nThe researchers also paid particular attention to the types of parenting being reported, and divided those styles into four groups:\nAuthoritative — both responsive and demanding\nAuthoritarian — not responsive but demanding\nPermissive — responsive but not demanding\nNegligent — neither responsive nor demanding\n \nResults showed that, for the population as a whole, preschool- and school-age children with authoritarian parents were 35 per cent and 41 per cent more likely to be obese than those with authoritative parents.\nBut household income had an effect for the younger, preschool-age cohort. Among kids living in poverty (i.e., living below the low-income cut-offs established by Statistics Canada), the risk of being obese was 20% greater compared with the risk among kids not living in poverty, and this risk was regardless of parenting style. However, among kids not living in poverty, authoritarian and negligent parenting was associated with 44 per cent and 26 per cent increased likelihood of obesity, respectively.\nKakinami speculates that this could be linked to kids’ ability to self-regulate their energy intake. “Authoritarian parenting may translate to parents not responding to children's cues of hunger and/or feeling full, and demanding or controlling the child's energy intake,” she says.\n“That results in the children's ability to regulate their own energy intake being underdeveloped. These children may be more likely to overindulge when given the opportunity.”\n*Partners in research: This study was supported in part by the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Santé.

He just works hard.\n“It comes down to time management, but you have to be balanced,” says the third-year actuarial mathematics and finance student in Concordia's Department of Mathematics and Statistics and a member of the Institute for Co-operative Education .\n“Get involved. Volunteer. There’s no secret, you just have to put the work in.”\nOn November 7, Azzoparde was awarded the Bourse Gilles Joncas, given to the top co-op student in Quebec by the Association canadienne de l’enseignement cooperative (ACDEC), Quebec branch.\nThe honour recognizes a student’s academic achievements, performance during work terms, participation in extra-curricular activities and volunteer contributions.\nAzzoparde’s work-term supervisors have nominated him twice for the Co-op Employer’s Choice award, and he was one of only 46 actuarial students in the world selected to attend the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) international student conference in Chicago this past August.\nBy the time Azzoparde officially graduates in spring 2016, he’ll have completed three internships in three different departments — retirement consulting, health and group benefits consulting, and investment consulting — at the Montreal branch of Towers Watson, an American global professional services firm.\n“Jason impressed us with his high level of maturity, his motivation, his technical capabilities and his ability to learn quickly,” says Marie-Pier Otis, Azzoparde’s supervisor from Towers Watson during his work term last winter.\nGerry Hughes, director of the Institute of Co-operative Education at Concordia, says Azzoparde was a highly recommended candidate for this bursary, along with two other Concordia Co-op students: “He has an incredible balance in that he wants to succeed, he has the drive to succeed, and he always treats people in a respectful manner.”\nAzzoparde says the fast-paced, stimulating working environment has allowed him to learn a lot in a short time, setting him up well for when he finishes school.\n“Each team offers something different, which is good for any student hungry to learn. It allows me to see many different aspects of the actuarial industry, so I can decide what track to take upon graduation.”\nFinding balance\nAlthough he has just added a major provincial prize to his resumé, Azzoparde says the accomplishment he’s most proud of so far is passing five professional, actuarial exams while balancing his busy schedule, maintaining a high GPA, and earning strong reviews from his work-term supervisors.\n“Sports gave me a balance to the stress of performing academically,” says Azzoparde. | Photo by Tiffany Azzoparde\nEvery morning during his work terms, Azzoparde would arrive at the office early to study. The hard work has paid off and he’s already managed to pass more actuarial exams than most students he spoke to at the SOA conference last summer.\nRanked in the top 15 per cent of his academic program, Azzoparde is also a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society and played two seasons with the Concordia Stingers football team.\nIt’s unusual for a Co-op student to become a member of a varsity team at Concordia, due to the time commitments required. But Azzoparde’s exceptional work ethic earned him a spot on the squad.\n“Sports gave me a balance to the stress of performing academically,” he says. “It was a passion for me. My mind was off my studies and it helped in the long run.” After two seasons, Azzoparde was forced to leave the team this year to participate in a work term.\nIn spite of everything he’s achieved so far, Azzoparde remains modest, saying he didn’t expect to be selected for the Gilles Joncas Bursary.\n“It was an unbelievable feeling. I don’t go through life expecting things. I treat every achievement like it’s my first, and I don’t take anything for granted.”\nOne thing Azzoparde shouldn’t have to worry about when he graduates from Concordia is finding a job. However, he does want to make sure that whatever he ends up doing is meaningful. “I really want to make a difference in whichever role I assume in life,” he says.\nWith his resumé, the sky’s the limit.\nRead the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada’s  press release  about the employability of co-op and internship students.\n \n"}

This past year alone, he taught nine.\nDavis, who earned a PhD from McGill University in 2004, is an expert in the field of electromagnetic engineering. He's sometimes hired as a consultant by medical, biomedical or telecommunications companies. While the contracts are lucrative, he says he’d rather be in the classroom.\n“You don’t teach for the money; you teach because it’s a calling,” Davis says. “As long as it fits with your life, and you feel that you’re making a positive impact on other people’s lives, you do it. When you stop feeling that, it’s time to ask yourself, ‘Is there something wrong with what I’m doing? Has the environment changed?’ You have to adapt.”\nAdapting is the cornerstone of Davis’s teaching practice. The veteran instructor, who earned an ENCS Teaching Excellence Award last year, strives to align his curricula with the current demands of industry, and challenges his students to solve the sorts of problems they might encounter in the workplace.\n“Companies don’t hire an engineer because they already have all the answers,” he says. “An engineer is something who’s in the tool shed of a lot of companies, and they’re called on when there’s a problem.”\nWith the goal of creating a dynamic, interactive learning environment, Davis always includes ample time for questions and discussion in his classes.\n“The really skilled students have already read the book; they already know what I have to say,” he says. “What they’re in class for is to fill in the gaps. It’s really during the interaction that the learning occurs.”\nFor Davis, the ideal classroom is one in which the learning flows both ways. “It’s not my great knowledge being shared with the world so much as it is my understanding blending with their understanding,” he says.\n“Sometimes the students’ questions, or my answers, are actually developing a new type of understanding. That’s the whole point of this.”\n \nChristine Que: An unexpected career path \n“Growing up, I always said that teaching was a job I’d never do,” says Christine Que, a part-time faculty member in the Centre for Engineering in Society. “I didn’t like having the attention on me. Speaking in front of people was a kind of torture.”\nThanks to Que’s passion for languages, though, that changed. After a few years of working as an accountant, she left her hometown of Vancouver for Quebec City, where she studied French at Université Laval.\n“I needed a part-time job, and my French wasn’t good enough to get any other kind of job,” she says. “The one I did manage to get was teaching French at a private language school.”\nHer first class was daunting, but Que quickly got over her shyness and developed a love of teaching languages. “I enjoy the interaction I have with my students, particularly in the smaller classes, where I get to know each of them,” she says. “It helps to motivate them when they know that they’re not just a face in the crowd.”\nQue later came to Concordia to pursue a certificate in Teaching English as Second Language. She followed that up with a master’s in applied linguistics. As a graduate student, she taught two English as a Second Language courses for the Department of Education.\nAfter graduating, Que was offered a part-time job teaching Technical Writing and Research Methods for Engineers and Computer Scientists, a required class for master’s students in those disciplines who need to improve their English-language proficiency before graduating.\nThe course was a major challenge for Que. “There I was, facing 30 students, and I had no engineering background. It was a high learning curve!”\nShe soon adapted, though, and now teaches the course regularly.\n“I like the class because the students really seem to appreciate what you’re doing for them,” she says. “They’re a nice bunch who are curious to learn.”\nWith her limited seniority, Que can only teach two courses a year at Concordia for now, but she also picks up language classes at McGill University and Collège de Maisonneuve.\n“I have a pretty busy schedule between the three places, and I’m never bored,” Que says. “There’s so much to learn.”\n \nPierre Gauthier: “I want to be here as long as I can keep contributing.” | Photo courtesy Pierre Gauthier\nPierre Gauthier: A focus on real-world knowledge \nNext year will mark Pierre Gauthier’s 30th as a part-time instructor at Concordia. He hopes he’ll be at the university for 30 more.\n“I often joke that they’re going to have to kick me out of here,” he says.\nGauthier, PhD 96, began teaching at Concordia at 22, as a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. “I’ve been teaching like a madman ever since,” he says.\nBut that’s not all he’s been doing. For the last 25 years, Gauthier has also held down a full-time engineering job. He now works for Rolls-Royce Canada Ltd. As team lead for the company’s combustion numerical methods group, Gauthier is in charge of the mathematical models that analyze the combustion systems of jet engines used as stationary power plants.\n“I’m very lucky because I’ve got a foot in both worlds, and the two worlds communicate with each other,” he says. “Everything I do at work, I get to teach it here at Concordia.”\nStraddling the professional and academic spheres allows Gauthier to point to the real-life applications of what he’s teaching. That’s a touch his students appreciate.\n“The age-old question is, ‘When will I ever use this?’ Well, I can tell them, ‘I used it this morning.’ Then they pay attention,” he says. “I even bring in parts of engines, sometimes, and say, ‘The stuff we’re doing today may seem abstract, but we actually use it to figure out something specific inside the engine.’”\nTeaching also allows Gauthier to sharpen his own engineering and mathematical knowledge base. “It’s like going to the gym every day, in terms of keeping me on top of what I do at work,” he says.\nGauthier recently became an affiliate associate professor, allowing him to supervise graduate students and run his own research projects with them — something he had already been doing at work.\n“I’m a proud Concordia graduate, so I try and bring as many Concordia students as I can into Rolls-Royce to do internships and summer work terms,” he says.\nAlthough most of Gauthier’s courses draw on his mathematics and engineering expertise, he also teaches a course at the School of Extended Learning that provides struggling students with practical tools for success. “When I teach this course, I feel I’m really making a difference because I can see a change in them from the beginning to the end of the term.”\nAfter almost 30 years, Gauthier is committed as ever to his part-time job at Concordia.\n“I want to be here as long as I can keep contributing,” he says. “I have a lot of fun doing it.”\n"}

Argue with me!”\nTen years after completing her BA in psychology at Concordia, Tremblay returned to pursue a certificate in family education. The program director encouraged her to complete a second BA in applied human sciences instead. During an elective course in sociology, a light went on.\n“I just thought, ‘Okay. This is it,’” Tremblay recalls. “Sociology was the missing piece! I thought, ‘How can I understand the individual without understanding the social context?’ I needed to know more.”\nIn 2001, Tremblay completed her MA in sociology from Concordia, and a year later landed her first teaching job at the university. “I taught a 200-level course called Social Problems. I was a nervous wreck,” she admits.\nShe need not have worried. An avid reader and social theorist with a strong interest in inequality, deviance and social movements, Tremblay also brought years of experience as a volunteer with indigenous women and sex workers to her teaching practice.\nSociology instructor Francine Tremblay says her work experience, including volunteering with indigenous women and sex workers, “keeps my theory grounded.”\n“I like to have one foot in academia and one foot in the real world,” she says. “It keeps my theory grounded.”\nRecently, Tremblay was appointed chair of External Relations for the Concordia University Part-time Faculty Association (CUPFA). She is also working on a pilot research project aimed at assessing student engagement at Concordia, supported by a $4,000 grant from CUPFA.\nCommunity activism, a union role and academic research: it’s all part of being an engaged teacher who strives to create the same restless curiosity in her students. Tremblay says she’s happy to ruffle a few feathers if it means getting her classes really thinking about the issues affecting their society.\n“I want to confuse them sometimes,” she says. “As a matter of fact, it’s in my course evaluations. Apparently I confuse them. Good! I shape citizens. That’s my job.”\nPatrick McDonagh: a man with many hats\nA teacher, freelance writer and avid researcher in the field of disability studies, Patrick McDonagh is not sure what he considers his main gig.\nPatrick McDonagh, a part-time faculty member in the Department of English, is a frequent contributor to Concordia University Magazine.\n“A lot of effort goes into preparing a course. So it seems that when I’m teaching, that’s the main thing,” says the part-time faculty member in Concordia’s Department of English. “That said, I always have a lot of projects going on the freelance side, and I’m also doing a lot of academic research.”\nIn 1998, McDonagh received a PhD in humanities at Concordia for his study of cultural representations of intellectual disability in 19th-century England. A decade later his book, Idiocy: A Cultural History (Liverpool University Press, 2008), was published to critical acclaim. “McDonagh has set a new standard in the history of intellectual disability,” wrote one reviewer from Truman State University.\nCurrently McDonagh is co-editing a collection of essays on the history of ideas of intelligence and intellectual disability, slated for publication next year.\nThe British Columbia native traces his interest in cultural representations of intellectual disability to a summer job he held as a university student working with autistic children.\n“It ended up being quite fascinating — and some years later I also realized that this interest could become a research project,” he says\nIn 1987, before moving to Montreal to pursue his PhD, McDonagh turned his interest into action, co-founding a non-profit agency in Vancouver that provides support services for people with developmental disabilities, autism and acquired brain injuries. The Spectrum Society for Community Living is still active. While McDonagh is no longer involved in day-to-day operations, he remains on its board of directors.\nWhen he first arrived at Concordia as a PhD student, McDonagh immediately sought out work on campus to support himself. With no teaching assistant positions available at that time in his department, he took a job teaching technical writing to engineering students. After earning his PhD, he was offered a part-time position in the Department of English.\nThe job often requires McDonagh to quickly get a handle on weighty texts included in the syllabus for a course he’s never taught before. Yet he enjoys the challenge, and the payoff is that he gets the chance to discuss great works of English literature with his students.\n“I like the preparation, I like digging into it on my own, and the classroom itself is a stimulating environment,” he says. “There are always some good insights that come up — things I wouldn’t have thought of, that I find exciting to hear. It’s not a bad life, talking about literature with a big group of people.”\nRobert Mearns: teaching for the fun of it.\nPart-time faculty member Robert Mearns is celebrating 50 years of teaching mathematics at the high school, CEGEP and university levels. “If I had to do it all over again, I’d do exactly the same thing,” he says. “I guess I’m one of the lucky ones who’s made a career out of something I don’t regard as a job. That’s why I’m still at it.”\nMearns earned a BA and MA from Sir George Williams University, one of Concordia’s founding institutions, and then an MSc in mathematics from Concordia in 1979. After teaching high school in Chateauguay, Que., in the 1960s, he began working at John Abbott College in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Que., when it first opened in 1971. Four years later he took his first job as a part-time instructor teaching night courses in Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\nWorking at Concordia, he says, “was a chance to come down from the milieu where I was, which was kind of homogeneous, and deal with people from all over the world — listen to their stories about why they came here; some of them wanting to go back to their homelands, some not. It was a chance to open up.”\nAlmost 40 years later, Mearns has retired from his full-time role at John Abbott College, but he still teaches 200-level courses mathematics courses at Concordia. “Now I’m doing this just for fun,” he says.\nAnd how does he describe the particular moment that keeps bringing him back to the classroom?\nAfter more than four decades, Robert Mearns is still motivated by the moment his students \"get it.\"\n“When you see a student sitting in front of you with a stern look on their face, as you’re trying to describe something or explain something, and then all of a sudden they crack a smile... You know that they’ve got it,” Mearns says. “That’s a helluva reward for me. That’s what I get out of it.”\nWe’ll be running more part-time faculty profiles over the next few weeks. Stay tuned.\n \n"}

Wrong. As millions of students head back to school next week, more than half will use exactly that kind of thinking when faced with fractions for the first time. New research from Concordia University shows that for children to understand math, teachers must constantly make the connection between abstract numbers and tangible examples.\nHelena Osana, associate professor in the Department of Education, and PhD candidate Nicole Pitsolantis put this theory to the test in a classroom of fifth and sixth graders. Their findings — published in the highly regarded journal Teaching Children Mathematics, as well as the British Journal of Educational Psychology — show students understand math much more clearly when teachers use pictures and concrete models to demonstrate what fractions actually mean.\nThose connections are even stronger when the model is personally meaningful to the students. Write out “¾” on the blackboard and the concept is not so clear. Show kids ¾ of a shoelace or talk about running ⅓ of the way to school and suddenly they get it.\nAlthough many teachers already use models when talking about fractions — for instance, a picture of a pie with slices eaten — they often put them away too quickly. To prove that the continuous use of models made a bigger impact, Osana and Pitsolantis tried teaching with models for only part of the lesson, and then for the entire lesson.\nThey found that students showed much greater understanding when the models were present. “Our study shows teachers should not only include pictures and models while teaching fractions, but also have them side by side throughout the class while continually making clear connections between the concepts and the models,” says Osana.\nThe lessons learned from this research project have the potential to go beyond the classroom.\n“This is something not only useful for teachers but also for parents,” says Osana. “Because children are studying fractions, parents think they’re not able to help. But they can have positive effect on learning too. Something as simple as writing ‘¾’ out on a piece of paper, then demonstrating what it means to use ¾ of a cup of sugar, or filling up the gas tank until it reaches the ⅔ mark, then writing and pointing to the numbers ‘⅔,’ can really go a long way towards demystifying math.”\nPitsolantis, who also teaches fourth- and fifth-grade math at Lower Canada College in Montreal, says that the depth of misunderstanding that happens when models are abandoned surprised her. She and Osana are now running tests to determine how teachers can successfully incorporate concrete models into the curriculum for other grades.\nThis research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.\nRelated Links\n"}

Instead, the assistant professor in the Department of English opted to work these social media tools into her teaching. \"I figured, they want to write? I'll let them write in the way they want on the sites where they want to write,\" says Novakovich. \"The impulse to write using these new tools comes from the students so the practice engages them in a way few lectures could.\"\nNovakovich will be one of a handful of Concordia professors participating in a panel discussion and showcase on how to incorporate social media into course design at the upcoming conference titled e.SCAPE: Knowledge, Teaching, Technology, on April 3, 4 and 5 on the Sir George Williams Campus.\nFred Szabo | Photo by Concordia University\nFred Szabo is among the dozens of Concordia professors sharing his experiences at the conference. The professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics has more than 20 years experience with online teaching and learning. “Technology makes routine computations a breeze,\" says Szabo. \"But online learning also allows my students to turn to the lecture material when they want, as often as they want.\" \nSzabo sees other benefits to online learning, believing it enables greater collaboration between students and frees up class time for greater face-to-face discussion and exploration of material.\nAt e.SCAPE, he’ll deliver two presentations. One is a workshop on how to add interactivity to online courses; the other shows how to use Moodle to manage and improve teaching and learning experiences.\nCourse design will be the focus of another workshop at e.SCAPE featuring two Concordians. Joanne Locke, associate-dean, academic programs in the Faculty of Arts and Science, and Anne Wade, manager and information specialist in the Centre for the Study of Learning and Performance, created an online version of Introduction to Library Research Practices, a course that develops information-literacy skills. The original course, first developed more than 20 years ago, has evolved to teach fundamental research skills to undergraduates throughout the university. A year ago, Locke and Wade collaboratively developed the online version of the course.    \n“Taking the course online opened up information literacy to students looking for greater flexibility in their schedules,” says Wade. “Now, the course content can be delivered in a consistent fashion to students wherever they may be.”\nAnne Wade | Photo by Concordia University.\nLocke also points out, \"Students today are increasingly dependent on web-based resources and online search engines for their research. This shift to teaching online allows students a greater opportunity to sift through these resources, evaluate them, and participate more actively in demonstrations of search applications.\"\nSome professors worry that keeping up with emerging technologies poses a considerable challenge. Yet, it's a challenge many have answered through creativity and innovation. Professors who have integrated technology into their teaching also note that, although not every course can be taught effectively online and not every student learns best that way, they see the merits in these advances to teaching and learning.\nMany students do, too. In the past two years, registration in online courses at Concordia has risen steadily to 11,973 students during fall 2012, compared with 10,921 a year before, and 13,042 this winter, compared with 11,945 in the 2012 winter term. In surveys regarding their satisfaction with the course material, the way it was delivered and the opportunity for interaction with faculty and teaching assistants, 75 per cent of students indicated they are satisfied or very satisfied. \nResearch is being done by Concordia faculty to identify the conditions most favourable to enhancing educational experience through integrating technology. Novakovich, for example, has gone beyond using Twitter and Facebook as writing tools to study the impact multimedia narrative strategies and blogging have had on students’ writing skills. Her research showing blogging’s positive impact on the quality of their writing was recently accepted for publication in the Journal of Educational Technology and Society. Novakovich is currently pursuing a PhD at Concordia in education with a specialization in Educational Technology. \nThe e.SCAPE conference is designed to support Concordia's Academic Plan. The plan's three main priorities for the 2012-13 academic year are innovative and dynamic undergraduate offerings, graduate student recruitment, and investments in the libraries.\ne.SCAPE is scheduled Wednesday, April 3, through Friday, April 5, from 9 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Keynote addresses are scheduled daily at noon. The conference is open to the entire Concordia community: students, staff and faculty.

To qualify for this coveted certification, the university’s actuarial programs had to meet eight criteria including curriculum, graduate count and quality, and connection to industry.\nJosé Garrido, professor of mathematics and statistics and graduate program director. | Photo: Concordia University\n“We’ve been offering undergraduate actuarial programs for 30 years now, so this is a recognition of the quality of the students we graduate, the graduate education we provide, and the research that is carried out here,” says José Garrido, professor of mathematics and statistics and graduate program director.\nSchools designated as CAEs are eligible to apply for substantial multi–year education and research grants offered by the SOA, adds Garrido. “Every year, it’s harder to get funding because of budget and government cutbacks, and there are very few scholarships available for graduate students, especially if they’re international. So this is very good news, both to support our graduate students – who can apply for extra scholarships they weren’t eligible for before – and to receive research money for faculty members who want to pursue special projects. It’s exciting to have these new sources of funding.”\nEwa Duma, the actuarial mathematics program director, coordinated the CAE application with the SOA. Concordia had applied for CAE status when the program was launched during the 2008-09 school year, but did not meet the faculty size requirement.\n“We hired a new person last summer, so now we’re four professors actively teaching and researching in the program, and that really made all the difference,” says Garrido. “It’s thanks to the commitment of the Faculty of Arts and Science that we’ve been able to grow in a way that we now satisfy all these criteria.”\nAccredited programs are more attractive to prospective students, especially those pursuing graduate studies, because of the additional funding sources, he added. “The SOA has made a tremendous effort to communicate this news about our designation; they sent a press release to all their members worldwide. They are the largest actuarial professional organization in the world. This will also have an impact when we recruit new faculty members.”\nConcordia offers several other programs that have been accredited nationally or internationally:\n• All engineering programs offered by the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.\n• The John Molson School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Its Bachelor of Commerce (Major in Accountancy) Program is accredited by the Certified Management Accountants of Canada National Board of Directors.\n• The Specialization in the Exercise Science/Athletic Therapy program is one of six athletic therapy programs accredited by the Canadian Athletic Therapists Association in Canada and it is the only accredited program in Quebec and Eastern Canada.\n• The Department of Psychology’s clinical training program is accredited by both the Canadian and American psychological associations and by the Ordre des psychologues du Québec.\n• The MA in Creative Arts Therapies, Art Therapy Option, is accredited by the Canadian Art Therapy Association and the American Art Therapy Association.\nRelated links:\n•    SOA announces Concordia’s recognition as Center of Academic Excellence\n•    Faculty of Arts and Science (includes departments of mathmatics and statistics, and actuarial programs, exercise science and psychology)\n"}

He’s also enrolled in the Actuarial Mathematics/Finance Program, jointly offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the John Molson School of Business, which is quite selective: only about 15 students are accepted each year.\n“Steven has a cumulative GPA of 4.11 and he has already passed two professional exams of the Society of Actuaries,” says Yogendra P. Chaubey, chair of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\nThose achievements earned him the Morneau Shepell scholarship award, which was established for second-year actuarial math undergraduates who maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0.\nMa says he loves his program and wants to pursue a career as an actuary. He’s currently deciding whether to work for an insurance company or a consulting firm. The firm that sponsors the scholarship he won, Morneau Shepell Ltd., provides human resource consulting and outsourcing services.\nRelated links:\n"}
