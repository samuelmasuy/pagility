Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

But for most university students, the coming weeks mean final exams , mounting stress and negative moods .\nWhile that doesn’t seem like an ideal combination for great grades, new Concordia research shows that the occasional bout of bad feelings can actually improve students’ academic success.\nA study published in Developmental Psychology by Erin Barker , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science , shows that students who were mostly happy during their four years of university but who also experienced occasional negative moods had the highest GPAs at the time of graduation.\nIn contrast, the study also confirmed that students who experienced high levels of negative moods and low levels of positive moods often ended up with the lowest GPAs — a pattern consistent with depressive disorders.\n“Students often report feeling overwhelmed and experiencing high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms,” says Barker, who is also a member of the Centre for Research in Human Development .\n“This study shows that we need to teach them strategies to both manage negative emotions and stress in productive ways, and to maintain positive emotional experiences.”\nFor the study, Barker and her co-authors* worked with 187 first-year students at a large university. The researchers tracked the students throughout their four years of schooling by having them complete questionnaires about recent emotional experiences each year, beginning in the first year and continuing throughout their undergraduate degree.\n \nNegative emotions signal a challenge\n“We looked at students’ response patterns to better understand how experiences of positive and negative emotions occurred over time. We then combined average patterns to look how each person varied from their own average and examined different combinations of trait and state affects together,” Barker explains.\n“This allowed us to identify the pattern associated with the greatest academic success: those who were happy for the most part, but who also showed bouts of elevated negative moods.”\nThese findings demonstrate that both negative and positive emotions play a role in our successes.\n“We often think that feeling bad is bad for us. But if you're generally a happy person, negative emotions can be motivating. They can signal to you that there is a challenge that you need to face. Happy people usually have coping resources and support that they draw on to meet that challenge.”\nIn January, Barker and psychology graduate students Sarah Newcomb-Anjo and Kate Mulvihill will expand on this research by launching a new study focused on life beyond graduation. Their plan: examine patterns of emotional experience and well-being as former students navigate new challenges associated with finding work or entering a post-graduation program.\n*Partners in research: This study was co-authored by Carsten Wrosch , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, Andrea L. Howard from Carleton University and Nancy L. Galambos from the University of Alberta. The research was funded by a grant awarded to N. Galambos by the the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. \nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

What are my options?\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about admission to our graduate program in Clinical Psychology\nQ. I primarily want to be a Clinical Psychologist. What are the other local opportunities to develop the type of career that I want?\nA. There are many different graduate programs that allow one to have a career as a psychologist or therapist. Some local universities offer a Psy.D. in Psychology (e.g. psy.umontreal.ca/programmes-­et-­cours/cycles-­superieurs/doctorat‐en-­psychologie‐clinique/ ). This is a doctoral degree in Psychology that does not require the research component of a Ph.D. thesis. Other graduate programs include Counselling Psychology (e.g. www.mcgill.ca/edu‐ecp/), and Art, Drama or Music Therapy (e.g. creativeartstherapies.concordia.ca/ ). Different programs may or may not have the strict research pre-­requisites and heavy research component that are required for an M.A./Ph.D. Program in Clinical Psychology.\nQ. What are my chances of being accepted into the graduate “Research and Clinical Training Option” in Psychology at Concordia?\nA. Although we receive hundreds of applications from highly qualified honours students, we are only able to accept 11 new clinical students each year. Students that do not have a conventional honours undergraduate degree in psychology or its equivalent, or who have not completed an empirical research thesis as part of their undergraduate studies, can sometimes be at a further disadvantage.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist, but I don’t have an undergraduate degree in Psychology. What are my options?\nA. Due to our accreditation from the CPA and APA, we require certain pre-requisite psychology course competencies prior to entrance into the graduate program. You can enrol in a university undergraduate psychology program and complete these courses ‐ as listed in our honours degree equivalency checklist. If you already have a BA or BSc degree, you do not need to complete a second degree in psychology, merely the pre-requisite courses.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but it isn’t an honours degree. What are my options?\nA. This presents a little more of a problem. If you already have an undergraduate degree in psychology, you cannot enrol in a second undergraduate psychology degree program. You can enrol as an independent student in some cases, but many universities, including Concordia, restrict the higher level psychology courses to psychology majors. Thus, you may not have access to the courses you need when enrolled as an independent student. Some universities, including McGill, offer a special status student program to make up for any course deficiencies for graduate school ( www.psych.mcgill.ca/grad/program/application_admission.htm ). At the present time, Concordia does not have a qualifying program for this purpose.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but my grades are below what is required (minimum GPA of 3.5/4.3). What are my options?\nA. Grades aren’t the only factor taken into account when considering an applicant for graduate school. For example research experience is weighed very heavily. However, this particular program is very competitive and the odds of someone with a low GPA being accepted into the clinical program are very low. Some students feel that taking a few more courses and getting better grades will help. Usually a few courses will not have a great impact on the overall GPA and all courses are weighted equally during our admissions process.\nQ. I don’t have an Honours Psychology degree, but I have lots of work experience in counselling and/or therapy. Can my work experience be considered for my application instead of university courses or research experience?\nA. Our graduate program is heavily based upon the research-practitioner model. It is assumed that counselling/therapy skills will be taught once in the program so they are not a pre-requisite for entry into the program. Thus, pre-requisite coursework and research experience are considered most important for our admissions process and prior counselling experience cannot replace those.\nQ. If I apply to the graduate Psychology Program (Research Option) and I am accepted to that program, can I later switch to the Research and Clinical Option?\nA. No. If a student is accepted into the graduate program, “Research Option” they are not eligible to later apply to the “Research and Clinical Training Option”.\nChecklist 1\nPrerequisite Courses for the MA Program in Psychology, (Research Training Option)\nAn honours undergraduate degree in Psychology, or its equivalent, is required for the Research Training Option.

The master's degree requires a minimum of one year of full-time study and involves - in addition to the thesis - course work in psychological theory and advanced statistics, seminars in the student's area of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes), and directed teaching in our undergraduate program. The doctoral program involves similar advanced training: independent research; supervised reading, research and course work in subject matter and methods in the area of research specialization; program-wide research and methods seminars; and teaching experience. Doctoral studies require a minimum of two years of full-time study.\nResearch\nStudents are provided the resources to conduct research throughout their graduate education. All new students are accepted into our program by a faculty member who is willing to provide supervision and financial support. Thus, each student is associated with a research team comprised of faculty and graduate students. Research teams within the department are organized around four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes) and pursue a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) appetitive motivation and drug dependence, problems in human development, cognitive and perceptual processes, and anxiety disorders.\nBecause entering students have often had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, students who complete the Ph.D. degree achieve a high level of research specialization and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, most students have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences. There are several sources of funding within the Department for student travel to scientific conferences. Also, students are expected to publish articles on their research in scientific journals.\nExamples of recent student publications\nTrewartha, K. M., Endo, A., Li, K. Z. H., & Penhune, V. B. (2009).

You may select either the Major, Honours or Specialization . You can opt for the Bachelor of Arts (BA) or the Bachelor of Science (BSc) , which requires electives in the science.\nAre you a student registered in another department? You can add a minor in Psychology to complement your degree.\nWhat's more, Psychology BSc students may complete a Specialization or Honours in  Behavioural Neuroscience . \nBA or BSc?\nWhat is the difference between a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Science (BSc)?\nMost students will have to complete 90 credits to earn a Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Most courses are worth three or six credits. Therefore, to complete a Bachelor's degree one would have to complete the equivalent of 30, three credit courses. If you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream.\nIn terms of your Psychology courses, there is no difference between the BA degree and the BSc. The difference comes in the electives. Science students will select a number of their electives from the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics) while Arts student will select primarily from the arts and humanities.\nA science background is required for students contemplating careers in neuroscience and it may be an asset in applying for medical school.\nMajor, Specialization, or Honours\nWhat is the difference between Major, Specialization, and Honours?\nIf you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream. The minor is available to students majoring in a subject other than Psychology.\nThe Major consists of 42 credits in Psychology and is relevant for someone seeking a good general degree which could have applications in a variety of fields related to teaching, business, personnel, or community involvement.\nThe Specialization consists of 60 credits in Psychology and as a more concentrated program is appropriate for someone with career plans in an area involving Psychology. It can prepare students for employment in such areas as those listed above for the Major but is recognized as a more intensive degree. Depending on the selection of courses the Specialization may also provide a background for graduate work such as a Master’s degree in counselling Psychology, or social work, or even in an MBA program.\nThe Honours degree is the most intensive of all consisting of 66 credits of Psychology and including two Honours seminars and an Honours thesis in the last year. At least partly because of these courses this program gives the best preparation for admission to graduate school. Admission to Honours is by application and normally occurs after a student’s first 30 credits have been completed with a GPA of 3.5. Students may apply to the Honours program directly from CEGEP if they have a CRC of at least 28.\n"}

The program's goal is to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists who not only conduct research and contribute to the scientific base of the discipline but who are also competent mental health professionals. Because research is such an important part of our program, students seeking only professional training or who do not intend to continue to the PhD degree should apply elsewhere.\nOverview\nStudents with BA or BSc degrees begin their studies in the first year of the research and clinical training option, which includes course work in psychological theory and research design, clinical theory and practice, and a master's thesis. Students enroll in the MA in Psychology and the Diploma in Clinical Psychology. The MA portion of the research and clinical training option requires a minimum of one year of full time study, the Diploma an additional 8 months.\nFollowing successful completion of the master's thesis and courses, students continue doctoral studies, in which they receive advanced training in research methods, psychological theory, and clinical practice. Besides continuous involvement in research in one of the department's four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, and Human Development and Developmental Processes) during their training, students also conduct a doctoral thesis, which must be a substantive piece of original research. The doctoral program requires a minimum of two years of full-time study. Following their doctoral thesis research, students complete a one-year, full-time internship in a clinic or hospital setting. \nOur clinical psychology program has been accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association since 1986 and by the Ordre des psychologues du Québec since 2004.\nThe Canadian Psychological Association requires disclosure of information on the applicant pool, acceptance rates, diversity, graduates, and other details about our programme.

This means that we strongly endorse the principle that a scientist-practitioner has a research orientation to his/her practice, and we encourage clinical relevance in research. Our model encompasses learning and career pathways individually tailored to student interest and faculty expertise. This permits a wide range of research emphases including those of basic research, while at the same time placing the highest value on the close integration of science and practice. The principal objective of our program is to produce graduates who have the necessary skills to function as researchers and as practitioners, who may function as either or both, and who meet the highest standards in the science and practice of psychology.\nProgram goals & outcomes\nOur program adheres to the Accreditation Criteria and Principles of the Canadian and American Psychological Associations and the Ordre des psychologues du Québec in its specific goals for clinical training. The principal objective is that a graduate of our program be\ncapable of functioning as an investigator and as a practitioner, and may function as either or both, consistent with the highest standards in psychology (Belar & Perry, 1992, p. 72).\nOur specific objectives include that our graduates:\nBe capable of conducting and publishing high quality psychological research in domains that have the potential to enhance the practice of psychology.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the theoretical and empirical roots in psychology of both clinical research and practice, and of current relevant developments in other areas of specialization in psychology.\nDemonstrate specialized knowledge of the major theoretical, methodological, and empirical work in clinical psychology, with both adults and children.\nBe capable of implementing theory-based, research-supported clinical practice, including assessment and treatment, with both adults and children.\nDemonstrate ethical and professional awareness and conduct in both their practice and their research.\nBe competent in dealing with individual and cultural diversity in values, beliefs and customs.\nBe capable of communicating knowledge to others.\nBe capable of consulting effectively with other professions, clients, and organizations.\nBe familiar with models of supervision, and competent in the supervision of other professionals.\nFunctions for which students are prepared\nStudents in our program receive the necessary academic, scientific, and clinical training so that they may contribute to psychological science and clinical practice in significant ways upon graduation.\nOur goal is to produce clinical psychologists who are highly trained in both the science of psychology and the methods of clinical practice, and who embody the roles of both researcher and clinical practitioner.\nGraduates of our program go on to careers in clinical and/or academic psychology in settings including hospitals, universities, health care clinics, and private practice.  Their activities are diverse and can include assessment, therapy, intervention, research, teaching, consultation, supervision and/or program planning in a wide variety of client populations.\n"}

By using photographs and video of natural scenes, my aim is to isolate what properties of an image do we use to recognize and classify the type of scene we are viewing, and how do changes in these properties alter our perception of the image. This research employed traditional techniques such as psychophysics and eye tracking, as well as new techniques such as computational neuroscience, gaze-contingent stimuli modifications, augmented virtual reality, as well as studying the underlying neural activity using EEG. My research  also focuses on how various visual (e.g., macular degeneration), cognitive  (e.g., stress, dual-tasking), and the loss of other senses (e.g., hearing loss) effect the visual system, and in particular, eye movements.

First, the hippocampus and other nearby cortical areas are thought to integrate sensory inputs into a cohesive representation. Then, memory is stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. A major mechanism through which circuits of the brain can learn is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My lab examines how changes in synaptic strength occur in parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat. Electrophysiological recording techniques are used to monitor synaptic strength and to examine how neuromodulatory systems (cholingergic, dopaminergic) and rhythmic EEG activities control changes in how neurons interact with one another.\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students make important contributions to this research.

My clinical approach is to use empirically supported treatments that are tailored to fit the needs of individual clients.  My clinical interests include diagnostic assessment and individual psychotherapy, in adult and adolescent populations with major affective disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders.\nDINA GIANNOPOULOS,  APC  Administrative Director\nMy clinical interests are in the areas of depression and anxiety disorders.  I supervise students who are interested in conducting cognitive-behaviour therapy with adults.  Emphasis is placed on empirically validated cognitive-behaviour therapy techniques.  The client-therapist relationship is also examined in supervision.\nJENNIFER MCGRATH,  Research Interests\nMy therapeutic orientation is fundamentally guided by cognitive-behavioral principles and the use of empirically supported treatments while incorporating components of other orientations tailored to fit the needs of individual clients.  My clinical interests largely span the area of child health psychology to include Childhood Behavior Disorders, Developmental Disorders, Behavioral Medicine (Diabetes, Oncology/Cancer, Headache, Enuresis, Feeding/Eating Problems, Cardiovascular Disease, Sleep Disorders, Anxiety, Depression, Smoking Cessation, Medical Regimen Adherence, Coping with Chronic Illness, Coping with Stress), Psychoeducational Assessments, and Psychiatric Triage.  Students on my supervision team have the opportunity to learn how to conduct comprehensive psychoeducational assessments of children and adolescents as well as lead group therapy for parents and children with health related issues (e.g., sleep problems, smoking cessation, stress management).\nSYDNEY MILLER,  Research Interests\nI have two main areas of clinical interest which would be relevant for the subject populations likely to be seen at the clinic. In general, my therapeutic orientation in both these areas is cognitive behavioral. One area of interest is adult psychopathology involving a variety of problems including the anxiety disorders (e.g. agoraphobia, panic, social phobia, simple phobia), depression, couples with marital problems, assertiveness issues, and social skills training. Another area of interest is in adult health psychology. This involves the treatment of physical illness and related psychological problems. The type of clients who might be seen include individuals with weight problems, headaches, high blood pressure, back pain and insomnia.\nROISIN O'CONNOR  Research Interests\nMy clinical interests include the assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders as the single presenting concern for adolescents and adults, or when co-morbid with substance use (i.e., alcohol use) concerns/disorders.  I am also interested in the assessment and treatment of pathological gambling.  I approach my clinical work as a scientist-practitioner. Accordingly, I draw on cognitive-behavioural therapy and other empirically supported treatments. I emphasize the use of theory-grounded case conceptualizations, hypothesis testing, and on-going data collection throughout treatment.  Some of the intervention strategies I use are skills training, cue exposure, response prevention, behavioural experiments, and cognitive reevaluations.  As well, I support the use of motivational interviewing techniques.\nVIRGINIA PENHUNE,  CRDH  Member  Research Interests\nThe practicum in Neuropsychology is designed to teach students the fundamentals of neuropsychological assessment and to prepare them for external practica and internships in Neuropsychology or in domains that require familiarity with cognitive and neuropsychological assessment. \nThe practicum will include a didactic and training period, covering basic theoretical issues in Neuropsychology as well as, test administration and scoring, clinical interview and report writing, as well as review of common medical tests relevant for neurological populations (i.e., MRI, CT, EEG).  During this time, students will practice tests with other students and with at least one normal volunteer.  One practice testing session will be videotaped and reviewed with the supervisor.\nAfter satisfactorily completing the practice testing, students will go on to test 2-3 consecutive clinical patients over course of the year.  This will include reviewing the neuropsychological and neurological literature relevant to the particular disorder, putting together an appropriate battery of tests for each patient, administering the tests and writing a complete neuropsychological test report.\nNATALIE PHILLIPS,  CRDH  Member  Research Interests\nThe practicum in Neuropsychology is designed to teach students the fundamentals of neuropsychological assessment and to prepare them for external practica and internships in Neuropsychology or in domains that require familiarity with cognitive and neuropsychological assessment. \nThe practicum will include a didactic and training period, covering basic theoretical issues in Neuropsychology as well as, test administration and scoring, clinical interview and report writing, as well as review of common medical tests relevant for neurological populations (i.e., MRI, CT, EEG).  During this time, students will practice tests with other students and with at least one normal volunteer.  One practice testing session will be videotaped and reviewed with the supervisor.\nAfter satisfactorily completing the practice testing, students will go on to test 2-3 consecutive clinical patients over course of the year.  This will include reviewing the neuropsychological and neurological literature relevant to the particular disorder, putting together an appropriate battery of tests for each patient, administering the tests and writing a complete neuropsychological test report.\nADAM RADOMSKY  Research Interests\nMy main areas of clinical interest are the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders and related problems in adults. I use a cognitive-behavioural approach and support the use of this and other empirically validated treatments identified by the Canadian and American Psychological Associations. The practicum emphasizes the application of cognitive-behavioural models and methods, including: the development of a collaborative relationship, self-monitoring, exposure (both imaginal and in vivo), response prevention, relaxation techniques, behavioural experiments, hypothesis testing, cognitive/belief investigations, habit reversal, evaluation of treatment gains and relapse prevention. These and other strategies will be applied to a variety of anxiety disorders and related problems. \nANDREW RYDER  Research Interests\nMy therapeutic orientation is predominantly cognitive-behavioural, influenced by the existential perspective on the person and the ultimate goals of therapy, and by the interpersonal perspective at the level of moment-to-moment interactions between therapist and client. As a scientist-practitioner, I take an evidence-based approach, meaning that specific interventions are informed both by the published literature and by evidence obtained over the course of a specific case (e.g., assessments, mood diaries, observation). My clinical interests are assessment and treatment of anxiety, depression, and personality/interpersonal problems.\nLISA SERBIN, Director of Clinical Training, Member of  CRDH ,  Research Interests\nMy research and clinical interests focus on developmental psychopathology and children's health. Specifically, I am interested in disorders of childhood, and in the environmental and social contexts in which children's development takes place. My clinical supervision focuses on the assessment and treatment of children referred for learning, emotional, social and behavioral problems. The focus is on the child, the family, and the environment (including daycare, school, and home settings). Assessment and treatment typically focus on the development of age-appropriate social and cognitive skills, as well as on emotional, behavioral and family problems, with treatment modality determined by the needs of the case. In recent years children have been seen under my supervision for problems including learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, behavior and attentional disorders, conduct disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Students under my direction have learned to use cognitive-behavioral therapy, play therapy, crisis management, and family therapy approaches, and to integrate these diverse theoretical models in developing effective strategies for intervention.\nDALE STACK,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests\nMy clinical experience is in the area of assessment and treatment of difficulties that occur in children (and their families).    My particular focus is working with very young children (preschoolers) and their families.   This area encompasses a range of problems including (but not limited to) developmental delays, expressive and/or receptive language delays, pervasive developmental disorders, behavior problems, sensory and physical disabilities, adjustment difficulties, child management and parenting, and family issues.   My general approach is cognitive-behavioral.   I underscore the importance of comprehensive assessment and I utilize alternative assessment procedures when valuable (e.g., non-verbal, non-compliant, etc.,).   Given the age range of the children, my clinical work involves direct contact with the child and his/her parent(s)/caregivers (and family).\n \nClinical Supervisors (External)\nSome of the clinicians who have recently supervised clinical students from Concordia (as a primary or case supervisor) on a clinical practicum or internship in  external settings  are:\nPerry Adler, Mélanie Archambault, Susan Barza, Jeanne Beaudry, Karina Béland, Claude Bélanger, Nathalie Belda, Sophie Bergeron, Johan Binette, Irv Binik, Caminee Blake, Hildegard Brack, William Brender, Sophie Brière, Thomas Brown, Ken Bruce, Christiane Chalfoun, Tinaz Chinoy, Rebecca Cohen, Lois Colle, Mike Coward, Fern Cramer-Azima, Sylvie Daigneault, David D’Alessandro, Elaine De Guise, Paule Delisle, Mary DeRemer, Nathalie Desormeaux, Louise Dessertine, Nathalie Dinh, Marc Simon Drouin, Lucie Fortin, Hallie Frank, Danny Gagnon, Ann Gamsa, Carole Gendron, Marc-André Généreux, Constantina Giannopoulos, Sylvie Goulet, Judy Gradinger, Rachel Green, Linda Greenberg, Pierre Grégoire, Corinne Gutman, Esther Handelman, Karen Hardoon, Geneviève Janveau-Brennan, Martin Jodoin-St-Onge, Jasmine Joncas, Marilyn Jonesgotman, Dennis Kalogeropoulos, Felicia Kaufman, Leslie Klein, Nathan Kuperstok, Constance Lalinec-Michaud, Henry Lavigueur, François Lefebvre, Judith Le Gallais, Gabriel Leonard, Stephanie Leonard, Nathalie Liboiron, Robert Loveless, Solange Marchildon, Suzanne Marcotte, Stephanie Margolese, Chantale Martel, Valentin Mbekou, Muriel Michel, Daniel Moisan, Linda Moxley-Haegert, Carolyn Nelham, Sylvain Néron, Margaret O’Byrne, Zbigniew Pleszewski, Nancy Poirier, Cecile Quirouette, Sandra Rafman, Maria Ramsay, Christina Saltaris, Liliane Sayegh, Miriam Scherer Berkovic, Alessandra Schiavetto, Connie Scuccimarri, Monique Séguin, Esther Sidoli-Leblanc, Maxine Sigman, Thérèse Simard, David Sinyor, Liliane Spector, Dale Stack, Julie St-Amand, Chantal Ste-Marie, Guylaine St-Pierre, Maria Sufrategui, Angeles Toharia, Mary Tsonis, Julie Vachon, Monica Chantal Vasquez, Deborah Weissberg Morrison, Ruta Westreich, Anne Wittevrongel, Sepi Zargarpour, Phyllis Zelkowitz.\nProfiles of Clinical Faculty\nLUCIE BONNEVILLE\nMy clinical interests are in several areas such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety and psychotic symptoms.  My orientation is eclectic.  In general, I use techniques from the models of Humanistic, Psychodynamic, Existential and Cognitive therapies in short and long term psychotherapy with adults and late adolescence.\nSAM BURSTEIN, Clinical Psychologist at the Montreal Children’s Hospital and in private practice. \nMy clinical experience lies mainly in the area of working with children and their families, wherein the presenting concern is child-related.

These difficulties include (but are not limited to) depression, impulsivity or eating disorders. \nEarly adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life can affect the brain in many different ways; however, the neurotransmitter serotonin is of particular interest. That is because serotonin is (i) widely implicated in a variety of psychopathologies and (ii) important for brain development, especially during infancy or childhood  (i.e., serotonin, in fact, helps to actually “build up the brain”). The overarching theme of our research program is that early adversity could disrupt the stability of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin). This in turn influences the early development of brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and could predispose the individual to psychological problems later in life, particularly when exposed to subsequent stressful events. The studies we are conducting are done in clinical and non-clinical populations and use neuro-imaging (fMRI/PET), epigenetics (DNA methylation) and/or cognitive-behavioural assessments, and is funded by various sources, including CIHR and NARSAD. \nTopics of ongoing research projects include:\n- Impact of childhood trauma on brain processes and (risk for) mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood.\n- Effect of cognitive-behavioural interventions on DNA methylation and brain function in adolescents with depression.\n- DNA methylation, childhood trauma and psychopathology (in particular mood disorders and eating disorders).\n- Impact of peer victimization on brain development and DNA methylation\n- Gene-Environment studies on brain and mental health, using twin designs.\n- Impact of early stress on oral health.\n- Impact of in utero Bisphenol-A (BPA) exposure on brain development in children\nEducation\nPhD (Leiden University, the Netherlands)\nTeaching activities\nPsychopathology: Mood, Anxiety, and Personality Disorders (Psyc 440, winter 2016 and 2017)\nPracticum Neuropsychology (2016-2017)\nPublications\nSelected recent publications\nBooij, L., Welfeld, K., Leyton, M., Dagher, A., Boileau, I., Sibon, I., Baker, G.B.,  Diksic, M., Soucy, J-P., Pruessner, J.C., Cawley – Fiset, E., Casey, K.F., Benkelfat, C.(2016). Dopamine cross-sensitization between psychostimulant drugs and stress in healthy male volunteers. Transl Psychiatry. 2016 Feb 23;6:e740. doi: 10.1038/tp.2016.6.\nChiarella, J., Tremblay, R.E., Szyf, M., Provençal, N., Booij, L.(2015). Impact of Early Environment on Children's Mental Health: Lessons From DNA Methylation Studies With Monozygotic Twins. Twin Res Hum Genet. 2015 Nov 26:1-12.

My projects are aimed at identifying and measuring the fundamental characteristics of children's interactions and relationships with their peers and determining how these experiences affect behavioral development, emotional adjustment and physical health.   The four current themes of my research projects are (a) contextual/cultural variation in the peer experiences and the processes that account for variations in their effects, (b)  the intersection between peer experiences and psychophysiology especially the response to stress, (c) gene/environment interactions  and gene environment correlations and the long term consequences of peer experiences, and (d) gender differences especially as they are related to culture.\nSelected publications\nBukowski, W.

In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.\nFunding: My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Fonds de la recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQ-S), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Concordia University.\nCurrent graduate students: Franca Lacroix, Atyeh Heidari-Jam, Milan Valyear and Franz Villaruel\nResearch Assistants: Melanie Chahine, Sabrina Heffernan\nChaudhri lab, 2013\nBiography\nDr. Chaudhri earned her B.A. in Biological Foundations of Behavior with a concentration in Neuroscience at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA.

Frederick Westbrook.  As part of her doctoral research Mihaela visited the laboratory of Simon Killcross at Cardiff University where she embarked on research examining the role of dopamine in predicting fear.  Following completion of her PhD in 2006, Mihaela sought post-doctoral training back in the learning theory hub that is the School of Psychology at Cardiff University.  There she worked with prominent scientists including Rob Honey and Mark Good on the neurocircuitry of mnemonic integration and updating, and forged strong collaborations with John Pearce, John Aggleton, and Dominic Dwyer.  Her desire to study how the neurons change their pattern of firing as a result of environmental stimulation took her across the Atlantic to the laboratory of Geoffrey Schoenbaum. While holding appointments at University of Maryland and at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, she examined how cells in the central nucleus of the amygdala modulate their firing under conditions when fewer than expected rewards are delivered.  Mihaela was awarded a prestigious Pathways to Independence (K99/R00) award from the National Institutes of Health to conduct this work.  In 2014 Mihaela was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology where she joins the Centre for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology.\nBack to top\n"}

Distortions and creations of memories are particularly relevant to our understanding of day to day memory, experience and self-consciousness. This research has important implications in the legal (eye-witness testimonies, autobiographical memories, expert testimony), and clinical (causal attributions of current symptoms) contexts. We seek to better understand the factors at play when an individual attempts to remember real life events. Individual factors, like suggestibility and hypnotizability, social-psychological factors (beliefs, expectations) and cognitive factors like one’s attentional and perceptual networks are some of the factors that we believe important in understanding the construction of memories. A second area of research investigates the different aspects of hypnotizability and hypnosis. What makes an individual hypnotizable? Why do individuals respond differently to a hypnotic induction? What is the role of volition in hypnotic and non-hypnotic responses? How can hypnotic behaviours and experiences inform us on conscious and non-conscious processes? A final area of interest is the theoretical evaluation of the scientificity of psychological concepts that are commonly used in lay and professional contexts.  Examples of these are consciousness and non-consciousness, volition, intuition, repression, dissociation, body memories, etc.\nThe common thread relating these three areas is the evaluation of the role of non-conscious processes, proximal (attentional processing) and distal (beliefs), in the elicitation of overt behaviours and experiences.\nBack to top\n"}

My research program is based on the theory          that psychological stress is a risk factor only in those individuals who          are in some manner psychologically and/or biologically susceptible, and          that the etiology of cardiovascular disease is multifactorial in nature.          My approach has therefore been to examine alone and in interaction the          moderating influences of emotion, race, gender and family history on the          cardiovascular response to psychological stress. For example, we are currently          involved in two areas of research involving individual difference factors          in the risk for cardiovascular disease. One research stream involves the          study of hostile individuals who are at elevated risk for heart disease.          We are currently examining their cardiovascular responses to interpersonal          stress, and the potential role of serotonin in moderating the hostility-cardiovascular          relationship. A second stream involves the study of cardiovascular and          ambulatory blood pressure responses to laboratory and daily life stress          in Canadian Black men and women who are at elevated risk for hypertension          (high blood pressure).\nSelected publications\nMiller,            S.B., & Sita, A.

In 1994, after 18 months in a postdoctoral research position in Dr. Robert Sutherland's laboratory at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Mumby joined the Department of Psychology at Concordia University. In 1999 he joined the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology.\nFun fact\nI have chickens at home, and I'm thinking of ways to formally test their memory abilities. Seriously.\nResearch\nObject recognition, spatial memory, fear learning, context memory, neural systems\nOverview: My interests broadly include animal cognition, and the analysis and development of methods and procedures for assessing various types of memory in rodents. For example, some of our recent studies revealed concerns about the internal validity of a widely-used novel-object preference test of object-recognition memory. We are now developing a new and improved object-recognition task.\nWe also study spatial memory, fear learning, memory for contextual information, and the modulation of memory by contextual cues. We employ an array of behavioral paradigms to assess different aspects of memory, including water-maze, t-maze, radial-arm maze, and open-field tests of spatial memory, novel-object preference and delayed nonmatching-to-sample tests of object recognition, shock-probe fear learning, predator avoidance, and social transmission of food preferences.\nAdditional interests include the anatomy of memory systems underlying object-recognition and spatial memory. We occasionally conduct studies to assess these abilities in rats with surgical lesions of specific brain areas. Past studies have focused mainly on hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, amygdala, intralaminar and midline thalamus.\nTo develop their reputations as independent researchers, my graduate students are encouraged to pursue lines of inquiry they can call their own. The main requirements for a suitable research plan are: 1) the questions must be timely and important to behavioural neuroscientists, 2) we must have the financial and physical resources to conduct the research, and 3) we must have expertise with the required behavioural tests. Recent Ph.D. students did dissertation research on a rat model of schizophrenia, and the modulatory effects of estrogen on object-recognition memory.\nFunding\nMy research is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).\nLab members\nAn up-to-date list of lab members can be found at my lab website.\nBack to top\n"}

My research aims to explicate the positive (drinking to increase positive affect) and negative (drinking to reduce negative affect) reinforcement pathways that lead to problematic drinking, particularly for those transitioning from adolescence to early adulthood. Within this framework I examine the role of individual-level factors such as personality (i.e., motivational drive), anxiety, impulsivity, and alcohol-related cognitions (e.g., attitudes, associations, cognitive processes) to distinguish who is at risk and the processes of risk. In one line of my current work I am examining the interactive effects of behavioural inhibition/disinhibition and state affect on cue elicited alcohol associations, impulsivity, and subsequent alcohol use. Planned work in my lab includes: (a) refining measurement of alcohol-related cognition, such as assessments of implicit attitudes; (b) isolating social anxiety - and the intervening mechanisms - as a risk factor for negative reinforcement (self-medication) drinking in University students widely, and for women specifically; (c) integrating environmental-level factors (e.g., context)  into models of risk.\nGrant institution funding\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR )\nFonds de recherché sur la société et la culture Quebec ( FQRSC )\nSelected publications\nO'Connor, R.

By participating in research, these students have the opportunity to gain a better appreciation of psychological testing and experimentation. However, as there are potential risks associated with classroom recruitment and student testing, these guidelines are intended to facilitate the collection of participants and/or data in undergraduate classroom settings at Concordia University, while protecting the rights of student research participants.\nApproaching the Instructor\nThe instructor should be provided with the following information well in advance of the classroom visit:\nWho is supervising the project.\nWhen the recruiter would prefer to visit the class.\nHow long the class visit will take.\nThe nature of the recruitment (sign up sheet, screening questionnaire, etc.)\nWhat (if any) testing will occur at the time of recruitment.\nRecruiting in Class\nWhen the recruiter visits the classroom, the following information should be provided to the students:\nThe name of the recruiter(s) and the faculty member(s) supervising the project.\nContact information for the lab(s) in which the study is being conducted.\nWhat the study is meant to investigate.\nThe nature of the study (questionnaire based, interview based, brief description of experimental tasks, etc.).\nThe amount of time required to participate in the study.\nWhat compensation (if any) participants will receive for their time.\nWhen the study is being conducted (Are appointments set?, Can students drop by the lab?, etc.).\nStudent should be informed that the data that they may provide during the course of their participation are completely unrelated to their required coursework or grade.\nThat participation is completely voluntary and that participants can refuse or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences whatsoever.\nThe nature and/or limits of confidentiality in the study. Ideally, the recruiter should leave the room while sign up sheets and/or questionnaires are being completed so that students will be free to either participate or decline to participate.\nTesting in Class\nDue to the possible demands produced by testing in groups, in the presence of experimenters and/or in the presence of course instructors, testing in classrooms is discouraged.\nIf in-class testing is deemed to be essential, the following measures (in addition to the above 10 points) should be taken to protect students from coercion and to ensure the confidentiality of their participation:\nParticipants should be told that their results will not be made available to their instructor.\nParticipants who choose not to participate should not be separated or otherwise identified during classroom testing. (This may be accomplished by distributing packages to all students in the class and then stating that students are free to either spoil the materials or leave them blank before returning them.)\nIn addition to written debriefing (see below), students should receive a brief oral debriefing in class about the purpose of the study.\nDebriefing\nAll experimental and study participants have the right to be debriefed from psychological studies. In order to facilitate both a greater understanding of research in psychology and to provide other sources of related information about the study, student participants should receive a brief written debriefing sheet (less than one half page) upon completion of the study.\nThe debriefing sheet should contain the following information:\nThe name of the study, the experimenter(s) and the faculty supervisor(s).\nThe telephone and other contact information for the lab(s) in which the study was conducted as well as contact information for the University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Psychology Department Ethics Committee.\n*The nature of the study (hypotheses, goals, etc.).\n*Some information about the design of the study (groups, measures, etc.).\nA brief statement about the importance or implications of the study.\nCitation of one or two suggested articles or book chapters for further reading.\n*If the study involves deception, it is acceptable for items 3 and 4 to be somewhat vague when distributed in written form, provided that a full oral debriefing is given to each participant.

After completing his postdoctoral training with Dr. Yavin Shaham at the National Institute on Drug Abuse/NIH in 2002, he headed the behavioral laboratory in D-Pharm Ltd., Rehovot, Israel. At the same time, he was appointed a senior lecturer at the Academic College Tel Aviv-Yaffo. In 2004 he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University. He held a Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology of Drug Abuse (Tier II; 2004-2015).\nResearch\nDrug abuse, Relapse, Animal models, Behavioural neurobiology, Eating disorders\nOverview\nUsing an animal model for drug self-administration, the research in my lab targets the brain mechanisms underlying the strikingly similar behaviors characterizing drug addiction and eating disorders. In addition, I am interested in the effects of early-life experiences on the development of mental disorders, susceptibility to drug abuse and eating disorders in the adult organism.\nDrug abuse and eating disorders are having an increasing impact on Western Society. New and more effective treatments are only likely to be developed once the interaction between the neural systems that underlie these disorders are understood.\nMy research involves two main themes that are concerned with factors that promote and maintain substance abuse. The first arises from my previous work showing that food deprivation potently induced relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking in laboratory rats, and that this effect is attenuated by leptin, a hormone involved in appetite regulation and energy balance. These data indicate a link between substance abuse and eating control mechanisms. We use a model of food-restriction-induced relapse to drugs in rats that is based on the drug self-administration procedure. We then examine the brains of the manipulated rats in search of the mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenomena.\nThe second theme is concerned with the often-reported comorbidity of drug abuse with mental disorders, and more specifically, eating disorders. We are using activity-induce anorexia as a model for anorexia nervosa to study factors that affect vulnerability to drugs and natural rewards and identify changes in underlying neuromechanisms.\nFunding\nMy research has been funded by grants from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Canada Research Chairs program (CRC) and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).\nTeaching activities\nCourses taught in recent years\nPSYC 355 - Fundamentals of Behavioural Neurobiology\nPSYC 450 - Neurobiology of Drug Abuse\nPSYC 491 - Honours Seminar\nPSYC 714 - Central Topics in Psychology\nPublications\nSedkiS, Gardner Gregory J, Luminare A, D’Cunha TM, Shalev U (2015) Food restriction-induced augmentation of heroin seeking in female rats:manipulations of ovarian hormones.

My MA program included a specialization                                    in early childhood education and I spent many                                    hours working in the University Laboratory Nursery                                    School under the supervision of Dr. Mary   J. Wright.                                  Following the MA I spent   five long years living                                  in Edmonton,   Alberta. I worked as an Assistant                                    Supervisor, Edmonton Northwest Day Care Center,                                    which was a municipally funded day care center.                                    I also completed a post-degree program in Elementary                                    Education at the University of Alberta   and after                                  two years of teaching I   received my professional                                  certification   as an elementary school teacher.                                  During   one year I was a counsellor in an elementary                                    school and in the second year, I taught a special                                    education class. Subsequently I attended the   University                                  of Waterloo and completed my   Ph.D. in Developmental                                  Psychology in   1986. I have been a member of the                                    Education Department, Concordia, ever since. In                                    1998 I was a visiting scholar at Lancaster University,                                    England.\nEducaton\nBA (honours) Psychology, York                                    University\nMA, Developmental Psychology                                      with a Specialization in Early Childhood Education,                                      University of Western Ontario\nPost-degree program, Elementary                                    Education, University of Alberta\nPhD, Developmental Psychology,                                    University of Waterloo\nResearch interests and current projects\nCo-construction                                      of meaning in the sibling relationship: Beginning with my dissertation, my   research                                    has been concerned with the   longitudinal nature                                    of the quality of   sibling relations, the influence                                    of   the mother on the children's relationship                                      and self_disclosure between siblings. Furthermore,                                      I am interested in how siblings co-construct                                      meaning in their relationship through play,                                      caretaking, teaching and use of   internal state                                    language (i.e.,   references to emotional, mental                                      states). Recently my work has focussed on young                                      children's social knowledge and understanding                                      of the sibling relationship, particularly within                                      the pretend play context. Currently I am   examining                                    the relations between   children pretense negotiations                                    and   conflict resolution, as well as the development                                      of intersubjectivity in sibling play and associations                                      with the quality of the relationship.   Another                                    project is investigating the   associations between                                    disclosure,   intimacy, and the quality of children                                      peer relationships in middle childhood. My current                                      SSHRC-funded project is to examine sibling teaching                                      from a social-constructivist framework.\nInfluence of the design of dramatic play                                      centers on children's play: How the ecology of the early childhood classroom,                                      specifically dramatic play centers, affects                                      children's social and cognitive play.   This project                                    has both a theoretical   and applied focus. Based                                    on theory   regarding the importance of pretend                                      play in young children's development, I have                                      conducted a series of studies to determine how                                      to facilitate opportunities for dramatic play                                      in the early childhood classroom. Several of                                      my MA students have investigated   other aspects                                    of play, such as the   relationship between solitary                                    play   and children thinking styles or the influence                                      of different kinds of play materials (e.g.,                                      superhero or scripted toys) on children.\nChild care: Specifically recent                                      child care research and implications for Canadian                                      public policy. The majority of recent research                                      on child care emanates from the United   States,                                    however the Canadian context   differs from the                                    American in   significant economic and philosophical                                      ways. My work (with E. Jacobs) has pointed to                                      the importance of considering these differences                                      for the development of child care policy.   Professor                                    Jacobs and I are currently   engaged in a pan-Canadian                                    study of   curriculum in child care settings funded                                      through Human Resources Development Canada.                                      Specifically we are looking at provincial regulations                                      and guidelines for curriculum in child care                                      settings and how curriculum is taught   to future                                    educators enrolled in   community colleges. We                                    will also   conduct an inservice intervention                                      program focused on constructivist curriculum                                      for child care workers in three provinces (Manitoba,                                      Nova Scotia, Quebec).

It deals with psychosocial risk factors in childhood which increase the likelihood of disordered behavior and maladaptive lifestyles in adulthood. Our Concordia Longitudinal Risk Research Program which began in 1976 has been following inner-city aggressive and withdrawn French-speaking children into adulthood. The aim is to determine the factors that differentiate the developmental trajectories of at-risk children who do well from those who fare badly. The children are now in their thirties; so my current interest is in how they are doing in such domains as mental and physical health, employment, competence, affiliative ties, and parenting. I have a particular interest in gender role socialization, life stresses, social support, and coping efficacy as influences on outcomes in these domains of adult functioning. Studies in the risk research program currently deal with stress; intergenerational continuities of risk factors; and childhood predictors of adult adjustment.\nEducaton\nPhD Psychology 1960; McGill University\nSelected publications\nMartin-Storey, A., Ruttle, P.

Made in the UK between 1975-1978 while Marshall was teaching at Newcastle Polytechnic, these works reference Bruce Nauman's earlier Lip Sync from 1969, or the early video works of William Wegman. Parallel works Mouth Room and Arcanum illustrate Marshall's debt to feminist video practice and the 'semanalysis' theories of Julia Kristeva, with art as a signifying and re-signifying practice, as conveyed through Marshall's video theory in development at the same time. Retrospectively, Marshall's refrain of '...go through the motions of saying one thing and meaning another...' bespeaks the closet and the possibility of transformation. \"Go Through The Motions\" establishes the conceptual content and visual economy later explored by Marshall's \"Journal of the Plague Year\" and \"Pedagogue\".\n\"Pedagogue\", 1988, 11 min.\n\"Pedagogue\" is a 1988 collaboration between Stuart Marshall, author, playwright and performer Neil Bartlett (b.1958), and students at Newcastle Polytechnic. Marshall and Bartlett conceived Pedagogue as an improvised, agit-prop video to “cock a snook” at the Thatcher government's Section 28, in progress at the time. Section 28 was a repressive, homophobic legislation prohibiting the promotion of homosexual lifestyles that tried to turn the tide on two decades of LGBT political gains. By seeking to expose the absurdity of Section 28 Pedagogue humorously evokes the cultural opposition to regressive homophobic and anti-sex attitudes of the Thatcher's Britain promulgated in the right-wing press during the AIDS crisis. As a contemporary account states this 'deconstructs the two establishment myths that homosexuality can be \"taught\" and is \"infectious,\" thereby returning to pedagogical and pathological ideas of homosexuality, first explored in \"Bright Eyes\". (Quote from Between Imagination and Reality, ICA 1990.)\n\"Bright Eyes\", 1984, 80 min.\n\"Bright Eyes\" was commissioned by and first broadcast on UK television's Channel 4 in December 1984 in the context of a virulently homophobic media response to the emergence of HIV/AIDS. Marshall's innovative and experimental video-essay charts the media depiction of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease within the long durée of homosexual stigmatization and pathologization. For Marshall this entails earlier attempted sexual reform movements, political repression, ongoing censorship and entrapment. As a history of the present \"Bright Eyes\" combines archival material, historical reenactment and agit-prop theatricality with interviews featuring those on the frontline of the UK and US AIDS crisis such as lesbian and gay activists, health workers and people with AIDS. At the time, Marshall's historical, political and cultural analysis, radical image-text juxtapositions and intertextuality broke the mould and demanded an ethical and political response from its viewers. Displaying polemical attitude, artistic flair and intellectual acuity, \"Bright Eyes\" set the tone for AIDS cultural activism and analysis and continues to resonate with ongoing representations of HIV/AIDS and LGBTQI issues.\nProgram 2 — 17h:\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\", 1991. 74 min.\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\" is Marshall's follow-up to Bright Eyes commissioned by and broadcast through dedicated lesbian and gay magazine OUT on UK Television's Channel 4 in August 1991. Documenting the rise of US AIDS activism and the corresponding UK activist scene, Marshall features extensive interviews with members of ACT UP, QUEER NATION, their UK chapters and corresponding UK activist group OutRage! AIDS activist and OutRage co-founder Simon Watney maps out the US and UK scenes, while activist video by ACT UP and OutRage! members and affiliated groups demonstrates the step-change in the cultural and political self-articulation and self-determination of AIDS activism.\n\"Robert Marshall\", 1991, 10 min.\n\"Robert Marshall\", (filmed with the assistance of John Greyson) charts Stuart Marshall's journey to make a video and visit family in Canada. Here Marshall seeks out 8mm film footage of his earlier family life that includes his deceased father Robert, who died in the filmmaker's company during childhood. Marshall's Barthesian narrative is a eulogy to his father, a paean to the power of the moving image, an account of Marshall's alternative medical treatment for AIDS at the same time as offering a poignant reflection on mortality and memory. Influenced by the writings of the women's health movement and Susan Sontag's Illness As Metaphor Marshall states, 'I believe that one should take some control over one's own disease process.' As such, Robert Marshall parallels the work of UK artist Jo Spence, displaying a historically committed, materialist regard for ethical convictions and political content. These works ask who goes before and what comes after us, while remaining indicative of Marshall's singular and unfaded polemical, critical and artistic abilities.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThis retrospective is an event in conjunction with the public lecture:\n\"Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism and the AIDS Crisis:\nLearning in a Public Medium \"\n"}

Conversations are hosted by a volunteer moderator who is there to welcome everyone and keep things on track. To get things started, there’s a guest, or sometimes two, who get the ball rolling by sharing their ideas, experiences and questions. After that, it's all up to the participants.\nAs we attempt to understand the life cycle of a garment, how do we clothe ourselves more ethically? How can creative reuse help us to alleviate our ecological footprint? When thinking of a life cycle for garments, “cradle to cradle” is often the terminology used to describe garment conception from fibres to yarns and then from yarns to fabrics. Once fabrics are produced, garments or “end uses” are described. “End uses” can be developed to create beautiful fashion garments to everyday basic apparel. As a garment becomes mature and the product lifecycle expires, garments can be recycled back into fibres where the cycle is reborn and new concepts are developed.\nArt Hives’ Science Shop presents UrbanBodies : an exploration of what matters in our everyday lives and neighborhoods. This series of public art making conversational labs, held in collaboration with the University of the Streets Café program at Concordia University, will explore the theme of the body as it lives and dies, grows and ages, struggles and thrives in the urban environment.University of the Streets Café organizes bilingual, public conversations in cafés and community spaces across Montreal.\nGuests:\nHeather Sorella has worked in clothing manufacturing and textiles all of her life.

The subsequent objectives were: i) to reduce the initial concentration of carbon, nutrients, and color-forming substances compared to conventional treatment systems, ii) to investigate removal mechanisms in the new system under electric field, iii) to optimize the system by studying the relationship between various operating parameters. To achieve these objectives an innovative compact electro-anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EAnMBR) was designed and its high performance was researched in two operational configurations. In the EAnMBR, physicochemical, biological and electrokinetic processes interacted simultaneously permitting to control the effluent quality and sludge properties. The dark-color molasses-based wastewater containing the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (53,000 mgL-1), total nitrogen (2,300 mgL-1), total phosphorus (150 mgL-1), was selected for this research and submitted to multi-phase studies. The research allowed to define optimal operational conditions leading to removal of carbon, nutrients by 99% and to complete discoloration in the EAnMBR system. The novel system was compared with anaerobic membrane bioreactor showing performance superiority of EAnMBR in respect to COD, sludge volume reduction and filterability by 10%, 54% and 7%, respectively. A separate experimental phase was dedicated to optimize the energy balance in the novel system by the surface response method. The EAnMBR demonstrated outstanding results which make it a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for various applications, e.g. in food, agriculture and defence industries.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The name ‘Vichy’ soon came to be used to refer to the regime instigated by Pétain and his ministers. The shortcut was maintained and popularized in the postwar period, to the great displeasure of the Vichyssois, who have long been refusing to incorporate the war into the city’s history. Whereas the Vichy regime is considered one of the most defining historical events of France’s recent past, in the French memorial landscape of the Second World War, the city of Vichy continues to stand out as a non lieu de mémoire.\nThis dissertation investigates the wartime period in Vichy and explores how the population has dealt with the fraught legacy of the Vichy regime from 1944 to the present. My research examines how the interaction between national mythology, specific local concerns, and broader troubling issues have impacted – and often blocked – the formation of a local war memory. In the immediate postwar years, local resisters strove to establish a strong memory of the resistance. At the same time, a powerful victimhood myth emerged in response to the city’s fears of stigmatization and ostracism. The spa tourism’s recovery in the early 1950s marked a significant change in the city’s memorial politics, leading to the memory of the war being pushed into the background, thereby establishing a tradition of silence in Vichy. This, however, does not mean that the memories of the war never resurfaced. They did, especially during the Algerian War. In the 1950s, Vichy’s economy largely depended on colonial spa tourism. Known as the “Capitale d’été de l’Afrique du Nord,” Vichy was indeed a privileged summer destination for thousands of settlers, especially pieds noirs from Algeria. The fear provoked by the prospect of a grave economic crisis in the event that Algeria would become independent led to a rightward shift of the population. This shift provided the ideal environment for a pro-Pétain memory to gather strength in Vichy, beyond Pétain’s traditional extreme right base. While in the 1950s, Pétain’s myth also enjoyed a revival of popularity in France, it declined rapidly, when, following the end of the Algerian War, the extreme right hit historical lows. In Vichy, on the other hand, this counter memory continued to develop in the 1960s. In the post 1970s period, although the local Petainist memory went underground, no other memory has risen to occupy a central place in the local collective remembering of the war, turning the city into a non lieu de mémoire and making it a counter example of what has been happening in many other places across Europe, where the most shameful aspects of the Second World War have been memorialized.\nWhere\nRoom GM 930.48, Guy-De Maisonneuve Building (1550 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMost of the Researchers’ interest is focusing on Bridge Management System (BMS), by its Maintenance, Repair & Rehabilitation (MR&R) segments, while a good practice of bridge management should cover the conceptual design phase of a new bridge. Although conceptual design is one stage of a bridge life whereas there is still limited knowledge on how it should be conducted. Most often engineers’ decisions are based on their past experience and standard solutions, which are affected by the subjectivity. This approach, most probably, does not reflect the effective way to address different problems of consistency in the decision. To design a new bridge, many factors, like the cost and aesthetic behavior, have to be considered due to their ability to affect the final decision. Generally, decision-makers will make their final design and decisions based on those factors in addition to human subjectivity.\nThe objective of this research is to propose a methodology to develop systematic procedures that can help decision-makers select the most appropriate bridge type with its diverse components and to forecast its Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and other characteristics such as the public satisfaction and environment sustainability of the selected bridge type. The proposed methodology integrates a decision support system with a relevant database within an artificial intelligence environment (AI) and bridge information management tools in order to reduce the impact of human subjectivity on the decision taken during the conceptual design stage of bridges life.\nFor this purpose, Machine Learning technique, which is a part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) environment, will be the core of the proposed methodology. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with its back-propagation algorithm is adopted in order to identify the appropriate solution by setting up its engine guidelines. A polynomial regression method will first be integrated in the DSS: 1) to formulate the database in order to establish the needed functions; 2) to define the input values for the ANN; and 3) to verify the intermediate ANN weightiness of the proposed methodology engine based on historic data retrieved from the database. An investigation will be conducted in order to define bridge characteristics and parameters, to be used in the ANN, and that affect the final decision.\nElements of the ANN layers (Engine model) which include: Input, Hidden & output layers, have to be described based on a systematic and standardized process. The proposed methodology has the potential to be used in lower levels to determine other bridge components such as vertical structures, foundations and connection types. The objectives of the proposed methodology can be summarized as follow:\nAvoiding, as much as possible, the influence of human subjectivity on the decision-making process.\nListing and Ranking all the other possible alternatives.\nEnsuring equivalent and fair consideration for all factors affecting the decision, and especially reducing the possibility to miss and overlook the impact of some factors that could be ignored while proceeding with making the right decision by using conventional decision-making approaches.\nDeveloping a model that can be considered as a guideline for further use that can be applied within any decision-making environment and based on a relevant historic database and experts’ input.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMany industrial systems are nonlinear with “slow” and “fast” dynamics because of the presence of some “parasitic” parameters. These systems are usually labeled as “singularly perturbed” or “multi-time-scale” systems. Singular perturbation theory has been proved to be a useful tool to control and analyze singularly perturbed systems if the full knowledge of the system model parameters is available. However, the accurate and faithful mathematical models of those systems are usually difficult to obtain due to the uncertainties and nonlinearities.\nTo obtain the accurate system models, in this research, a new identification scheme for the discrete time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural network and optimal bounded ellipsoid method is proposed firstly. Compared with other gradient descent based identification schemes, the new identification method proposed in this research can achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain. Later, the optimal bounded ellipsoid based identification method for discrete time systems is extended to the identification of continuous singularly perturbed systems. Subsequently, by adding two additional terms in the weight’s updating laws, a modified identification scheme is proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the identification algorithm during the whole identification process. Lastly, through introducing some filtered variables, a robust neural network training algorithm is proposed for the system identification problem subjected to measurement noises.\nBased on the identification results, the singular perturbation theory is introduced to decompose a high order multi-time-scale system into two low order subsystems – the reduced slow subsystem and the reduced fast subsystem. Then, two controllers are designed for the two subsystems separately. By using the singular perturbation theory, an adaptive controller for a regulation problem is designed in this research firstly. Because the system order is reduced, the adaptive controller proposed in this research has a simpler structure and requires much less computational resources, compared with other conventional controllers. Afterwards, an indirect adaptive controller is proposed for solving the trajectory tracking problem. The stability of both identification and control schemes are analyzed through the Lyapunov approach, and the effectiveness of the identification and control algorithms are demonstrated using simulations and experiments.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nAn effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) technology can play a crucial role in improving the system availability, safety and reliability as well as reducing the risks of catastrophic failures. In this thesis, the robust sensor FDI problem of gas turbine engines is investigated and different novel techniques are developed to address the effects of parameter uncertainties, disturbances as well as process and measurement noise on the performance of FDI strategies. The efficiencies of proposed techniques are investigated through extensive simulation studies for the single spool gas turbine engine that is previously developed and validated using the GSP software. The gas turbine engine health degradation is considered in various forms in this thesis. First, it is considered as a part of the engine dynamics that is estimated off-line and updated periodically for the on-board engine model. Second, it is modeled as the time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty that affects all the system state-space matrices and third as an unknown nonlinear dynamic that is approximated by the use of a dynamic recurrent neural network.\nIn the first part of the thesis, we propose a hybrid Kalman filter (HKF) scheme that consists of a single nonlinear on-board engine model (OBEM) augmented with piecewise linear (PWL) models constituting as the multiple model (MM) based estimators to cover the entire engine operating regime. We have integrated the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based method with our MM-based scheme to estimate the sensor fault severity under various single and concurrent fault scenarios. In order to ensure the reliability of our proposed HKF-based FDI scheme during the engine life cycle, it is assumed that the reference baselines are periodically updated for the OBEM health parameters.\nIn the second part of the thesis, a novel robust sensor FDI strategy using the MM-based approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for mul- tiple PWL models. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibil- ity conditions. The main objective is to propose a robust filter that satisfies the overall performance requirements and is not affected by system perturbations. The requirements include a quadratically stable filter that ensures bounded estimation error variances having predefined values.\nIn the third part of the thesis, a novel hybrid approach is proposed to improve the robustness of FDI scheme with respect to different sources of uncertainties. For this purpose, a dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) is designed to ap- proximate the gas turbine engine uncertainty due to the health degradations. The proposed DRNN is trained offline by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) al- gorithm for an engine with different levels of uncertainty, but with healthy sensors. The convergence of EKF-based DRNN training algorithm is also investigated. Then, the trained DRNN with the fixed parameters and topology is integrated with our online model-based FDI algorithm to approximate the uncertainty terms of the real engine. In this part, the previously proposed HKF and RKF are integrated with the trained DRNN to construct the hybrid FDI structure.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis thesis contributes and provides solutions to the problem of fault diagnosis and estimation from three different perspectives which are i) fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using nonlinear multiple model approach, ii) inversion-based fault estimation in linear systems, and iii) data-driven fault diagnosis and estimation in linear systems. The above contributions have been demonstrated to the gas turbines as one of the most important engineering systems in the power and aerospace industries.\nThe proposed multiple model approach is essentially a hierarchy of nonlinear Kalman filters utilized as detection filters. A nonlinear mathematical model for a gas turbines is developed and verified. The fault vector is defined using the Gas Path Analysis approach. The nonlinear Kalman filters that correspond to the defined single or concurrent fault modes provide the conditional probabilities associated with each fault mode using the Bayes’ law. The current fault mode is then determined based on the maximum probability criteria. The performance of both Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are investigated and compared which demonstrates that the UKF outperforms the EKF for this particular application.\nThe problem of fault estimation is increasingly receiving more attention due to its practical importance. Fault estimation is closely related to the problem of linear systems inversion. This thesis includes two contributions for the stable inversion of non-minimum phase systems. First, a novel methodology is proposed for direct estimation of unknown inputs by using only measurements of either minimum or non-minimum phase systems as well as systems with transmission zeros on the unit circle. A dynamic filter is then identified whose poles coincide with the transmission zeros of the system. A feedback is then introduced to stabilize the above filter dynamics as well as provide an unbiased estimation of the unknown input. The methodology is then applied to the problem of fault estimation and has been shown that the proposed inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of faults. Second, a solution for unbiased reconstruction of general inputs is proposed. It is based on designing an unknown input observer (UIO) that provides unbiased estimation of the minimum phase states of the system. The reconstructed minimum phase states serve then as inputs for reconstruction of the non-minimum phase states. The reconstruction error for non-minimum phase states exponentially decrease as the estimation delay is increased. Therefore, an almost perfect reconstruction can be achieved by selecting the delay to be sufficiently large. The proposed inversion scheme is then applied to the output-tracking control problem.\nAn important practical challenge is the fact that engineers rarely have a detailed and accurate mathematical model of complex engineering systems such as gas turbines. Consequently, one can find a trend towards data-driven approaches in many disciplines, including fault diagnosis. In this thesis, explicit state-space based fault detection, isolation and estimation filters are proposed that are directly identified from only the system input-output (I/O) measurements and through the system Markov parameters. The proposed procedures do not involve a reduction step and do not require identification of the system extended observability matrix or its left null space. Therefore, the performance of the proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the errors in the Markov parameters estimation process. The estimation error dynamics is then derived in terms of the Markov parameters identification errors and directly synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation errors have been effectively compensated for. The proposed data-driven scheme requires the persistently exciting condition for healthy input data which is not practical for certain real life applications and in particular to gas turbine engines. To address this issue, a robust methodology for Markov parameters estimation using frequency response data is developed. Finally, the performance of the proposed data-driven approach is comprehensively evaluated for the fault diagnosis and estimation problems in the gas turbine engines.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

These systems can be reversibly and controllably transformed between several different stable conformations, and will respond to orthogonal stimuli. The synthesis, electronic properties, and switching characteristics of several responsive IIN-containing small molecules will be presented. \n \nBio\nSara Eisler obtained her BSc. from the University of Alberta in 1998. While working for Prof. Rik Tykwinski during the summer months of her final year, she developed a rather unhealthy obsession with alkynes, causing her to stay on in the Tykwinski group to obtain her Ph. D. A post-doctoral position at ETH-Zürich in the group of Prof. François Diederich followed, where organic materials chemistry (and alkynes) were set aside to investigate gene transfection vectors. She subsequently moved to Montreal in 2006 to work with Professor Jim Wuest to study crystal engineering. Since joining the faculty at the University of New Brunswick in 2008 as an assistant professor, she has continued to design and synthesize organic materials.

Kristin is on the board of directors of the  Borneo Orangutan Society Canada , and the author of two books on the philosophy of animal minds.\nAbstract:\nTraditionally, discussions of moral participation – and in particular moral agency – have focused on fully formed human actors. There has been some interest in the development of morality in humans, as well as interest in cultural differences when it comes to moral practices, commitments, and actions. However, until relatively recently there has been little focus on the possibility that nonhuman animals have any role to play in morality, save being the object of moral concern. Moreover, when nonhuman cases are considered as evidence of moral agency or subjecthood, there has been a tendency to focus on higher-order moral behaviors (i.e., those same behaviors that inform our views about human moral agency). If we are to understand the evolution of moral psychology and moral practice, then this relative lack of attention to the practices of other animals and this persistent focus on the moral instead of the normative have been great oversights.\nA biologically responsible way of examining the distribution of moral practice in other animals starts from considering the distribution of normative practice across species. Drawing on the work of psychologists and anthropologists, the normative foundations of morality across humans demonstrates that some animals—chimpanzees and cetaceans in particular—demonstrate many of the moral foundations that indicate the existence of a cognitive modality I call naïve normativity.\nWhere\nRoom 201, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis dissertation analyzes the convoluted process by which Irish nationalists, Irish unionists, and British politicians negotiated Irish self-government in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In December 1909, a modest form of self-government known as home rule within the British Empire for all of Ireland became a practical issue in United Kingdom politics again, after the failure of two previous home rule bills in 1886 and 1893. After a decade that witnessed a world war and a revolution in Ireland, two new Irish polities emerged by June 1922. Northern Ireland, a majority-unionist state comprised of six counties in the province of Ulster, acquired a limited form of home rule within the United Kingdom. Covering the rest of the island, the Irish Free State secured significant control of its domestic affairs as a dominion of the British Empire, though not the complete independence demanded by Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had waged the revolution.\nHow did the main political parties and actors in Britain and Ireland arrive at this settlement, especially as it was so different from how elites had envisioned Irish self-government in 1909? Using archival material and public discourse, this dissertation seeks to answer this question by methodically analyzing the political decisions taken by British and Irish political parties and movements between 1909 and 1922. It challenges historical conceptions that the settlement enacted by the Government of Ireland Act (1920) and the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) was an inevitable evolution in Anglo-Irish relations, that it marks the British government’s recognition of the Irish right to self-determination, or the triumph of Irish democracy. Instead, I argue that the settlement was highly contingent upon prevailing political circumstances, heavily influenced by British interests, and often defied the democratic demands of Irish people, both nationalist and unionist. Partition, the separation of Ireland into two different states, was achieved through the acquiescence of British politicians to the demands of Ulster unionist leaders, without reference to public opinion in any part of Ireland.\nWhere\nRoom H 1001.01, Henry F.

Re-search-for-design is defined as a research activity performed by the designer in order to inform the design process. This study aims to better understand the contribution of research-for-design education, not only as a required activity in the design process, but also as a strategy to develop a vision for sustainable design. This comparative study examined two university design programs, the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí in San Luis Potosí, Mexico. I examined student and teacher accounts of how research is taught in each program. Through a process of comparative analysis, I identified differences in the participating students and educators’ backgrounds and design streams which led to varied perspectives of disciplinary practice. Formal and informal methods of doing research-for-design were identified and linked to accounts of teaching and learning. These practices in the education of research-for-design included intuitive, informal, spontaneous, ludic, innovative, visual, creative, social, and emphatic strategies. Teaching research-for-design demands an effective way to connect students with their entire environment. By doing this, the education of research-for-design will empower students’ understanding of the design process with the potential to promote ethical, sustainable, comprehensive, and integrative design.\nWhere\nRoom EV 2.776, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis thesis collects three articles that explore the construct of reflected appraisal –individuals’ beliefs about how they are seen in the eyes of others. These manuscripts are linked by the overarching question “How do employees manage the bombardment of myriad reflected appraisals in their daily organizational lives?” To address this, the articles examine four workplace manifestations of reflected that are represented by the constructs of perceived supervisor support, organizational support, respect and external prestige (also called image) while considering the referents inherent in each construct (i.e., Co-workers, team members, the employing organization and external stakeholders). The theoretical manuscript (article 1) examines the four reflected appraisals together, asking what contextual and individual factors predict which reflected appraisals employees are more likely to focus on and when. We use employees’ work-roles as the key construct that links these factors together, arguing that self-motives drive individuals to focus on some reflected appraisals under the constraint of accountability and interdependence that are part of the organizational structure. The quantitative manuscript (article 2) examines the concurrent impact of respect and prestige on relational and organizational identification. In a survey of student-athletes from varsity sports teams, we found that the matching principle prevailed: Prestige and respect that are focused on the relationship predicted relational identification while respect and prestige focused on the collective predicted organizational identification. However, prestige was the better predictor of both the relational and organizational foci. The qualitative manuscript (article 3) focuses on organizational image and explores how individuals respond to perceived organizational stigma. I interviewed employees of general contractors during a city-wide scandal in which various audiences marked their organizations as “the enemy” by virtue of their category-membership. I found that interviewees negotiated two images that embodied individuating and de-individuating reflected appraisals of their organization. Furthermore, employees constructed these images using various sources of information that they integrated into their reflected appraisals. Overall, the three articles demonstrate that employees actively engage with a plethora of reflected appraisals from multiple referents in the organizational environment.\nWhere\nRoom MB 12.101, John Molson Building (1450 Guy), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

It does this by engaging current scholarship on “Comedy,” building upon some of its fundamentals, yet showing that the picture we get of “Comedy” in this literature should be supplemented. To this end, the paper explicates Hegel’s claim that the individual is a “negative power,” and then develops a central point in Hegel’s section on “Comedy,” namely, that in comedy abstract universals are put in play and revealed as they are actually made concrete in the lives of individuals. This reveals the pretensions of abstract universals, unmasking the gap between what we might think of a universal, such as honesty, and this universal in it concrete/actual form. It this pretense and gap that Hegel finds comedic.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

Gavin is completing his MA in Philosophy at Concordia.\nAbstract:\nWhat is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia manifests differently in different cultures, according to different modes of understanding. Modern scientific understandings of the disease categorize it as a neurological disorder, primarily biological or genetic in nature, with the experience of the disease manifesting in the ‘split mind(s)’ (schizo- phrēne) of patients. But there is mounting empirical evidence to suggest that biogenetic and neurologically reductive approaches are limited with respect to their treatment outcomes, and – as I argue – specifically alienating to patients. Patients are faced both with social alienation, and a sense of alienation from self – I argue that this is primarily by the disease’s interaction with its cultural and political situatedness, rather than by the manifestation of disease itself. Leaning on Marx and Foucault, I seek to readdress the question of schizophrenic ontology in this essay, motivating for a model that will attenuate the experience of alienation thought symptomatic of schizophrenia by approaching it as dialectical co-production of both biogenetic, and sociocultural factors. The result is to argue for the irreducibility of the experience of vulnerability in future research seeking to open up treatment options for patients with schizophrenia.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

This fact highlights the importance of improving indoor air quality (IAQ) in in areas including sustainable buildings. Among different air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a major part of indoor pollutants. The proven negative impact of these compounds in occupants’ health has motivated researchers to develop different air treatment technologies for the removal of VOCs.\nDevelopment of plasma-based methods, and their remarkable capabilities for VOCs degradation, has motivated designers to employ these methods as indoor air purification. It has been demonstrated that utilizing a dual functional adsorbent/catalyst (DFA/C) in a plasma system can significantly enhance the VOCs removal and energy efficiency of such an air purifier. However, selecting an appropriate DFA/C is a challenge to achieve the best performance in these systems.\nFor the first time, this research attempted to utilize metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as DFA/Cs for a plasma-driven catalytic reactor. Accordingly, three different MOFs, MIL-101 (MIL: Metal institute Lavoisier), MIL-53, and CPM-5 (CPM: Crystalline Porous Material-5), were synthesized through microwave, solvothermal and mechanochemical methods. To test the performance of these DFA/Cs, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was designed and implemented as a non-thermal plasma (NTP) set-up. During preparation and evaluation experiments, different characterization and analytical instruments, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatogram/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS), Ozone monitor, and VOC Photoionization detector (PID), were utilized.\nSeveral adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted to study physical and chemical behaviors of MOFs for the removal of one (1) ppm toluene and isobutanol on MIL-101, MIL-53 and CPM-5. Also, the effect of the presence of 30% relative humidity on the adsorption capacity and oxidation ability of each MOF was investigated. Results showed physisorption of VOCs on all MOFs during the course of adsorption tests. Moreover, the stable structure of the examined MOFs before and after plasma-catalytic reactions indicated a facile regeneration of catalysts. During the plasma-catalytic oxidation of toluene and isobutanol, different organic by-products and ozone were detected either in dry or humid conditions for all MOFs.\nMIL-101 and MIL-53 exhibited much higher adsorption and oxidation ability compared to CPM-5 in most of the experiments. Results demonstrated a higher adsorption capacity and almost the same oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 compared to MIL-53 in dry air. Nevertheless, the negative influence of humidity on adsorption and oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 was more significant than in MIL-53.\nIn conclusion, results demonstrated the potential capacity of MOFs as DFA/Cs in a NTP system.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

While conventional water and wastewater treatment technologies are effective at providing clean, usable water, these methods are inadequate for the complete removal of these emerging aquatic contaminants. Unlike naturally occurring aquatic organic compounds, these emerging contaminants must not only be removed from aqueous systems but also degraded to non-toxic constituent compounds. Membrane filtration is currently one of the most effective technologies for water purification, but conventional membranes lack mechanisms for contaminant degradation. Many environmental contaminants are highly susceptible to aggressive oxidative or reductive degradation. This is achievable with electro-filtration along with electro-enhanced oxidation and reduction processes.\nElectrochemical filtration is a promising technology that aims for the efficient removal of persistent contaminants that cannot be effectively eliminated through conventional treatment methods. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and carbon substrates can be employed as filtration media to which a DC potential can be applied for further electrochemical treatment.\nThis study consists of two main objectives: firstly, an investigation of MWNTs and carbon substrates and the use of electrochemical filtration in dead-end filtration systems, and secondly, the application of the same technologies in crossflow filtration systems for the removal and degradation of model persistent organic contaminants. Through the course of the study, MWNTs were employed as filtration media and tested under different surface conditions and solution chemistries with the aim of achieving the most effective elimination of the model persistent organic contaminants.\nIbuprofen and Bisphenol A, two emerging contaminants of concern, have been reported to exist in natural waters, influent, secondary treated effluent of wastewater, and in primary and secondary wastewater sludge. In this study, dead-end electrochemical filtration was investigated as a removal method for these contaminants. This technique has shown promise in the elimination of both of these compounds and the reduction of their overall toxicity. In these dead-end electrochemical filtration experiments, we employed multiwalled carbon nanotubes as both a filtration and electrode material. As well, the stability of MWNTs was studied under different surface and bulk structural conditions.\nCarboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs-COOH) were used with the aim of increasing the filtration efficiency for the removal of carboxylated ibuprofen under different pH and electrolytic conditions. It was found that the presence of oxy-functional groups can increase the functional surface area of MWNTs and increase the filtration capacity in low voltage applications. In high voltage applications, it was found that electrochemical filtration is controlled by bulk electroactive species. Boron doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (BMWNTs) were also studied, with the goal of improving electrical conductivity during bisphenol A electrochemical filtration experiments. It was found that despite previous reports describing the higher oxidative power of doped carbon nanotubes, with the highest reported for BMWNTs, pristine MWNTs and BMWNTs showed similar outcomes in eliminating bisphenol A. The results indicate adequate performance and efficiency of pristine MWNTs in removing bisphenol A. These results demonstrate the dead-end electrochemical filtration as a promising technology for the removal of these emerging contaminants.\nThe removal of ibuprofen and bisphenol A was also investigated by using crossflow electrochemical filtration for individual and equimolar mixture solutions. The aim was, firstly, to investigate electrochemical filtration performance under the horizontal shear flow mechanism in a flat sheet crossflow setup. Large surface area, superconductive MWNT blend buckypaper membranes were used as electrochemical filtration electrodes.\nThe crossflow configuration shows great potential in eliminating these two contaminants in both individual component and mixed solutions from pure and fouling electrolytes. This outcome can mainly be attributed to the crossflow mechanism and can be assigned to the horizontal shear flow, which likely leads to a consistent surface coverage, combined with the greater conductivity of the MWNT blend buckypaper membrane. The long residence time within the membrane likely leads to a significant reduction in toxicity under applied voltage. Our results suggest that the electrochemical filtration technology based on MWNTs has a potential for use as a polishing step for removal of emerging contaminants from natural waters and secondary wastewater effluents.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

In recent years, the initiative has expanded to include writers from the department of Art History and designers from the department of Design and Computation Arts. Together, a uniquely designed catalogue illustrates the diversity of works and texts that reveal the breadth of talent found within the faculty of fine arts.\nWe are pleased to introduce a new layer to this year’s iteration and are working with performers from Concordia’s department of Contemporary Dance. As such, the growing collaboration has compelled us to come up with a theme to unify the participating disciplines. The thematic of “space” was introduced to encourage thought-provoking concepts that stem from notions of space, which has the potential to be interpreted broadly within various creative practices. For example, there is the space between generations, pictorial space, the space between performer and audience, geographic space, queer space, political space, outer space, to name only a few.\nThe FOFA Gallery salutes the extraordinary work of the artists, writers, designers and dancers proving that cross-disciplinary practice continues to be an engaging approach within the creative process. We also wish to acknowledge the dedicated guidance from professors in all of these departments who have inspired a dynamic illustration of current interests and artistic explorations.\nFaire des espaces\nExposition des étudiants et étudiantes de premier cycle\nDu 16 janvier au 17 février 2017\nFR\nDepuis plus de trente ans, les étudiantes et étudiants de 1er cycle de la Faculté des beaux-arts de l’Université Concordia présentent leurs œuvres dans le cadre d’une exposition annuelle. Ces dernières années, l’initiative s’est enrichie de la contribution de rédacteurs du Département d’histoire de l’art et de designers du Département de design et d’arts numériques. Ensemble, ceux-ci réalisent un catalogue original où œuvres, textes et facture graphique mettent en lumière l’ampleur des talents issus de la faculté.\nC’est avec plaisir que nous ajoutons un nouveau volet à l’édition de cette année grâce à l’apport d’artistes du Département de danse contemporaine. Pour nourrir cette collaboration florissante, nous avons jugé utile de choisir un thème qui unifierait les disciplines participantes. Ainsi, nous avons mis de l’avant le concept d’« espace » afin d’encourager la réflexion sur un sujet se prêtant à une multitude d’interprétations au sein de diverses pratiques créatives. Par exemple, l’espace entre les générations, l’espace pictural, l’espace entre l’artiste et le public, l’espace géographique, l’espace queer, l’espace politique ou l’espace extraterrestre.\nLa Galerie FOFA salue le travail extraordinaire des artistes, rédacteurs, designers et danseurs, qui prouve que le croisement des disciplines demeure une démarche stimulante dans le processus de création. Nous souhaitons enfin remercier les membres du corps professoral des divers départements, dont le soutien dévoué a inspiré cette illustration dynamique des réflexions théoriques et des explorations artistiques de l’heure.\nArtists / Artistes\nLand of Plenty (detail) (2016), Jordan Beaulieu.

He will offer his perspective on the process consulting stance and on the dilemmas that often arise when a consultant intervenes in complex social systems. Conklin will suggest that the skilled intervener engages in four critical balancing acts:\nBalancing the need to challenge and at times push the client toward success with the need to create safety and to show compassion for the client. The intervener is confrontational and compassionate.\nBalancing the need to engage in planned and intentional activity with the need to be open to the emergent and unexpected. The intervener stays the course and changes course.\nBalancing the need to become part of the client system with the need to remain distinct and apart. The intervener participates and observes.\nBalancing the inclination to tell the client the solution to client problems with the need to create the conditions in which members of the client system can discover the answers for themselves. The intervener asserts and inquires.\nThe evening will allow participants to consider the strengths and opportunities that await those who wish to become more conscious and effective facilitators of social change.\nWhere\nRoom RF-100, Loyola Jesuit Hall and Conference Centre (7141 Sherbrooke W.),\nSpeakers\n"}

We’ll also discuss whether our current method of running elections, and of voting, are outdated, and whether major changes are (or should be) forthcoming.\nGo beyond the basics and dig deeper into economic, political, and procedural underpinnings of elections.

But for most university students, the coming weeks mean final exams , mounting stress and negative moods .\nWhile that doesn’t seem like an ideal combination for great grades, new Concordia research shows that the occasional bout of bad feelings can actually improve students’ academic success.\nA study published in Developmental Psychology by Erin Barker , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science , shows that students who were mostly happy during their four years of university but who also experienced occasional negative moods had the highest GPAs at the time of graduation.\nIn contrast, the study also confirmed that students who experienced high levels of negative moods and low levels of positive moods often ended up with the lowest GPAs — a pattern consistent with depressive disorders.\n“Students often report feeling overwhelmed and experiencing high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms,” says Barker, who is also a member of the Centre for Research in Human Development .\n“This study shows that we need to teach them strategies to both manage negative emotions and stress in productive ways, and to maintain positive emotional experiences.”\nFor the study, Barker and her co-authors* worked with 187 first-year students at a large university. The researchers tracked the students throughout their four years of schooling by having them complete questionnaires about recent emotional experiences each year, beginning in the first year and continuing throughout their undergraduate degree.\n \nNegative emotions signal a challenge\n“We looked at students’ response patterns to better understand how experiences of positive and negative emotions occurred over time. We then combined average patterns to look how each person varied from their own average and examined different combinations of trait and state affects together,” Barker explains.\n“This allowed us to identify the pattern associated with the greatest academic success: those who were happy for the most part, but who also showed bouts of elevated negative moods.”\nThese findings demonstrate that both negative and positive emotions play a role in our successes.\n“We often think that feeling bad is bad for us. But if you're generally a happy person, negative emotions can be motivating. They can signal to you that there is a challenge that you need to face. Happy people usually have coping resources and support that they draw on to meet that challenge.”\nIn January, Barker and psychology graduate students Sarah Newcomb-Anjo and Kate Mulvihill will expand on this research by launching a new study focused on life beyond graduation. Their plan: examine patterns of emotional experience and well-being as former students navigate new challenges associated with finding work or entering a post-graduation program.\n*Partners in research: This study was co-authored by Carsten Wrosch , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, Andrea L. Howard from Carleton University and Nancy L. Galambos from the University of Alberta. The research was funded by a grant awarded to N.

At what age can children explain people’s behaviours as being guided by their mental states? Who do toddlers trust to teach them new things — and why?\nThese questions, and others like it, have been the focus of Diane Poulin-Dubois ’s research for the last 31 years at Concordia. The psychology professor from the Faculty of Arts and Science leads the Cognitive and Language Development Lab .\nOn October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award — the Prix Acfas Thérèse Gouin-Décarie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.\n“Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois’s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.\n“We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois’s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l’ACFAS (faculty award). She was also on the organizing committee when Concordia hosted the 2014 Acfas conference , “Research: Zones of Creativity and Convergence, ” welcoming 5,100 scholars and offering 173 colloquia.\nPrevious Acfas winners from the Concordia community include Michel Laroche , John Molson School of Business marketing professor, André Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, Sherry Simon , French professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science, Marguerite Mendell , professor and graduate program director for the School of Community and Public Affairs, and François-Marc Gagnon , founding director of the Gail and Stephen A.

She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.”\nThis career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.\n“We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.” Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example, “dog/chien”) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation.\nHer other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called “trust,” which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.\n“We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,” says Poulin-Dubois.\n“My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to? Then you can speculate how our species has evolved differently or similarly to others.”\nPraise from the department\nWilliam Bukowski , psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Centre for Research in Human Development , is thrilled that Acfas is recognizing Poulin-Dubois.\n“Diane has been at the forefront of understanding how the concepts that were popular in a Piagetian perspective can now be applied to other domains of functioning, such as bilingualism,” he says. \n“She is remarkable in her capacity to develop rigorous and very creative laboratory tests.”\nBukowski also points to Poulin-Dubois’s success as a supervisor.\nTwo of her graduate students, Cristina Crivello and Sabrina Chiarella, have won Graduate Research Communicator of the Year Awards for their papers on the benefits of bilingualism and early trust. “When your students win awards, it reflects well on everyone.

The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world.\nToday, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career.\nI grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education.\nWhen applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be “a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.”\nI had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade.\nThis allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students’ results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents.\nI have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died.\nMy hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.  \nOn Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution.\nThe government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years.\nI have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture “of the moment.” We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face.\nThe main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum — I am referring to those who did not participate.\nBut in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.\n \nFind out more about Concordia's Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it’s good for mind and body.\nIn fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood — but in markedly different ways.\nThe researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.\n“We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,” says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study’s lead author.\nIn particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain’s two hemispheres — in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.\n“This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,” Giacosa explains. “Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.”\n‘This work has major potential’\nInterestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field.\nAccording to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other. “Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.”\nVirginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study’s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.\n“This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,” Penhune says. “Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.”\nSome studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.\n“Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson’s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,” says Penhune.\n*Partners in research: The co-authors of this study — Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J. Karpati, Nicholas E.V. Foster, Virginia Penhune, and principal investigator Krista L. Hyde — are all members of the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research.

In 2015–16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity .\nThe series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.\n“Last year really exceeded our expectations,” says André Roy , dean of FAS. “So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.”\nOn Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season, “ Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,” invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations.\nHeld in collaboration with Concordia’s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes .\nAccording to Roy, this year’s series won’t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A. “We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.”\nClaudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public.\nGauthier’s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age. “I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,” she explains.\n‘Thinking outside the box’\nFellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.\n“I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,” says Chapman. “I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.”\nAnother first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the “Come to your senses” event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .\n“I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,” explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .\n“I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.”\nRoy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.\n“We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats.

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.\n“Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in — even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,” says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.\n“Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.”\n \nHormones influence problem-solving\nFor the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a “hormonal profile” questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits.\nThe participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways.\nAt the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end.\nResults were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks.\nThat proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks — such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words — depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle.\nEssentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.\n“This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,” says Brake.\n“For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones”\n'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain'\nFor recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study’s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.\n“Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants — and male rats — in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,” she says.\n“I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.”\n"}

He has accepted a professorship in Université de Montréal’s Faculty of Medicine, where he will be conducting research on exercise and brain health at the Montréal Heart Institute.\nBherer will continue his association with Concordia as associate scientific director.\nHabib Benali | Photo by David Ward\nStepping in as interim scientific director of the preventive health centre is  Habib Benali , a professor of electrical and computer engineering and PERFORM's associate scientific director of biomedical engineering.\nGraham Carr, Vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies, says Bherer has made truly exceptional contributions to Concordia.\n“He has really put his imprint on PERFORM as a centre for innovation and collaboration in the field of prevention and healthy lifestyle, which is one the most dynamic areas of health research and training.  The new opportunity he is pursuing speaks to the world-class quality of his personal research program — and to the respect that Concordia is earning as an important and unique contributor to the field of medical research in Montreal,\n“As the inaugural PERFORM chair and scientific director, Louis’s vision, energy, appetite for collaboration and ambition for success have put the centre on the map. His tireless work has enabled us to recruit outstanding faculty of international quality, attract top-quality students and postdocs and emerge as an important new partner in the Quebec and Canadian landscape of health research.\n“I am proud of and grateful for everything that Louis has given to Concordia. He is a true leader. I know I am not alone in being sad at his decision to move over the mountain, but I am very eager to pursue new collaborations as he embarks on the next phase of his astonishing career.”\nFor his part, Bherer is proud of what the PERFORM research team has been able to accomplish over the last four years. “We’ve laid the foundation for our mission of advancing research, education and community engagement while offering unique opportunities for new discoveries in preventive health research,” he says.\n“With the support and guidance of the exceptional team of researchers, students and staff we have established, PERFORM will continue to blossom in the years to come.”\nLooking forward, Carr is extremely pleased that PERFORM will be in safe hands under the leadership of Habib Benali, given the scope of his international research and administrative portfolio, his extraordinary connections with the health research community in Montréal and his commitment to the institutional vision for PERFORM.\n“We are unbelievably fortunate that a person of Habib’s calibre and experience is poised to accept the interim scientific director position,” says Carr. “As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM’s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.”\nBenali’s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position.\nPrior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Université de Montréal.\nBenali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM — part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University — until 2015.\nHe looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,” he says. “I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.”\nCarr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia’s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.\n \n"}

People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,” says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.*\nEvery second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year — the denouement, if you will.\nEthnodramas and 100 original songs\n“The theme of our show is 'We Can',” says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director. “The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.”\nPart of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist.\nThe CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas — plays based on the performers' lived experiences — as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.\n \nStephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience. “Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.”\nGoulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. “They always want me to come back, and I never say no.”\n‘Taking everyone for who they are’\nChoreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga .\nSanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.\n“It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,” she says. “They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.”\nFrom the stage to the big screen\nThe Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .\n“When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,” says Snow.\nBecause the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale.\nCrafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase.\nGet your tickets today for the Centre for the Arts in Human Development retrospective show, A Night at the Oscar , taking place June 17 and 18 at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall.\n*The Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health recognizes individuals or organizations for building awareness of mental health issues in the community through research, service, advocacy, combatting stigma or calling the public’s attention to the needs of family caregivers. It was presented to Stephen Snow at the Annual General Meeting of AMI-Quebec Action on Mental Illness on June 7.\nRelated Links\n"}

Just like Pavlov’s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink.\nIndeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .\n“Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,” says Nadia Chaudhri , the study’s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .\n“Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.”\nThe results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them.\nAccording to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn’t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.\n“Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,” Chaudhri explains.\n“These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.”\nFor the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol — the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks.\nThe researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue.\nThis happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered.\nThe researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable.\nSo how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?\n“Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,” says Chaudhri. “By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.”\nShe explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.\n“This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,” says Chaudhri.\n“Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.”\nChaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.\nRead the cited study here , led by Nadia Chaudhri, professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology . \n \n"}

This excellent and enlightening book deserves the widest readership.\"\nFor more information, including further testimonials and a link to the book's page on the Cornell University Press website, see the publisher's press release, please see below.\n \n \nCornell University Press is proud to announce the publication of Violence as a Generative Force, an in-depth look into a multi-ethnic community’s collapse into intercommunal killing during the summer of 1941, and the resulting transformation of its residents’ lives. The book’s findings have global implications for the study of mass violence and civil war, and will appeal to a wide variety of scholars, as well as to policy makers and NGO advocacy workers with interests in the possibilities and limits for preventing and/or stopping violence.\nFor more information about Violence as a Generative Force, see below and visit the book’s page on the Cornell University Press website:   http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100065060\nViolence as a Generative Force is also available as an ebook from Amazon/Kindle, Apple iBooks, Barnes & Noble/Nook, Google Play, and Kobo.\nAbout Violence as a Generative Force\nDuring two terrifying days and nights in early September 1941, the lives of nearly two thousand men, women, and children were taken savagely by their neighbors in Kulen Vakuf, a small rural community straddling today's border between northwest Bosnia and Croatia. This frenzy—in which victims were butchered with farm tools, drowned in rivers, and thrown into deep vertical caves—was the culmination of a chain of local massacres that began earlier in the summer. In Violence as a Generative Force, Max Bergholz tells the story of the sudden and perplexing descent of this once peaceful multiethnic community into extreme violence. This deeply researched microhistory provides provocative insights to questions of global significance: What causes intercommunal violence? How does such violence between neighbors affect their identities and relations?\nContrary to a widely held view that sees nationalism leading to violence, Bergholz reveals how the upheavals wrought by local killing actually created dramatically new perceptions of ethnicity—of oneself, supposed \"brothers,\" and those perceived as \"others.\" As a consequence, the violence forged new communities, new forms and configurations of power, and new practices of nationalism. The history of this community was marked by an unexpected explosion of locally executed violence by the few, which functioned as a generative force in transforming the identities, relations, and lives of the many. The story of this largely unknown Balkan community in 1941 provides a powerful means through which to rethink fundamental assumptions about the interrelationships among ethnicity, nationalism, and violence, both during World War II and more broadly throughout the world.\nAbout the Author\nMax Bergholz is Associate Professor of History at Concordia University in Montreal, where he holds the James M. Stanford Professorship in Genocide and Human Rights Studies. \nPraise for Violence as a Generative Force\n\"Violence as a Generative Force is a beautifully written, insightful, theoretically driven, compelling book. Max Bergholz is a gifted storyteller who lures the reader into a deeply complex story of multisided civil conflict, one that challenges presumptions about the processes and motives of violence.\"—Emily Greble, City College of New York, author of Sarajevo, 1941–1945: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Hitler's Europe\n\"Violence as a Generative Force sheds light on ethnic violence in original and illuminating ways. This remarkable book takes the gripping events in a small and often overlooked Bosnian community and places them in a startling new analytical perspective.\"—Edin Hajdarpasic, Loyola University Chicago, author of Whose Bosnia? Nationalism and Political Imagination in the Balkans, 1840–1914\n\"Violence in the Balkans has been overdescribed and underexplained. By dint of phenomenal research, vivid reconstruction, and meticulous analysis, Max Bergholz uncovers the truth about interethnic killing in a Bosnian provincial town during 1941. At once dispassionate, spirited, and profoundly responsible, his inquiry proves the transformative power of extreme violence to create identity. This excellent and enlightening book deserves the widest readership.\"—Mark Thompson, University of East Anglia, author of Birth Certificate and A Paper House\n\"Max Bergholz's Violence as a Generative Force is meticulously researched, engagingly written, and discerning in its judgments. It offers important new insights into the intercommunal violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina during World War II, but even more importantly it makes a significant contribution to the study of the dynamics of mass violence and how violence shapes identity and social relations in multiethnic societies. It should appeal to a wide multidisciplinary audience.\"—Mark Biondich, Institute of European, Russian and Eurasian Studies, Carleton University, author of The Balkans \n\"Violence as a Generative Force is a rare and challenging piece of scholarship: an ethnography of the past that shows how humans' darkest capabilities can also produce new forms of social solidarity. Max Bergholz asks very big questions about very small places, which is precisely the way to understand that most awful of social phenomena: the decision by one set of neighbors to throw another set down a cave.\"—Charles King, Georgetown University, author of Odessa and Midnight at the Pera Palace\n\"In this meticulously researched book, based on extensive archival work, Max Bergholz holds a microscope to a largely forgotten episode of violence in 1940s Bosnia. Informed by scholarship that spans multiple disciplines and regions, Bergholz's powerful analysis shows how violence shapes ethnicity—and in varied ways. While deeply anchored in Bosnia, this book has far-reaching implications for scholars of violence, social identity, and rural politics.\"—Scott Straus, University of Wisconsin–Madison, author of Making and Unmaking Nations  \nJoin the conversation\n"}

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

{"url": "http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/students/undergraduate/appointments-academic-advisors.html", "field": "artsci_psychology", "title": "Appointments with Academic Advisors", "text": "Honours\nAm I on track to graduate?\nIn order to graduate, you are required to complete a specific number of Psychology credits and outside electives. Outside electives are courses offered in other programs outside of Psychology. You also must ensure you have completed any missing profile courses. To check your progress in our program, and track to make sure you are going to be able to graduate, use the program check sheets here: https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/students/undergraduate/monitoring-academic-progress.html\nIf you are still uncertain after having completed the program check sheet, you can make an appointment to see an academic advisor. Always bring the completed checklist with you when seeing an academic advisor\nWhen will I finish my degree?\nThis depends on your degree, the number of credits you need to graduate (90, 108, 120), the number of credits taken per semester, and if you also take summer courses. For example, if you are a full-time student taking 12 credits per semester, you can complete 90 credits in 4 years. If you take 15 credits per semester, it will take you three years to complete 90 credits.\nHow many credits do I need to do per semester?\nTo be a full-time student in Quebec, you must take a minimum of 12 credits per semester (usually 4 courses). The maximum load is 15 credits per semester (usually 5 courses). If you are worried about the workload that university courses require, we recommend you start out with 12 credits (i.e., 4 courses) in the first semester. If you can handle the workload, then go to 15 credits in subsequent semesters. If you are thinking of applying to Medicine, Law, or Graduate Degrees, then please check with the schools you plan to apply to for the degree requirements (some schools expect you to take a 15-credit to demonstrate that you can handle the workload).\nShould I take 4-5 Psychology Courses per semester?\nPsychology courses tend to demand more work from the student than other general elective courses. This is especially the case for courses that have a laboratory component (i.e., PSYC310, PSYC315, PSYC311, PSYC316). While it is possible to take a full Psychology course load per semester, it is not recommended. Instead, taking 2-3 psychology courses, in addition to 1-2 general electives is recommended.\nFor the summer semester, how many courses should I take?\nGiven the shorter more compact nature of the summer courses, we recommend taking no more than 6 credits (i.e., two courses) per summer term. Students wishing to receive financial aid during the summer are required to undertake 12 credits during the two summer terms.\nShould I drop a course?\nStudents will sometimes think they should stay in a course even though they are doing poorly, as they have heard that a DISC looks bad on their transcript. It is ok to have a DISC on your transcript – this happens from time to time as students like the initial idea of a course, but find it different when taking it.  Also, as DISC is better than receiving an F for a course, as a poor grade affects your GPA (a DISC does not count towards your GPA). However, try to not make a habit of having too many DISCs.\nDo I need to meet with an advisor to repeat a course?\nStudents can repeat a course at any point, without making an advising appointment. The exception is if you are trying to repeat a course which is a prerequisite for another course you are or have taken.\nStudents should think of the following before repeating a course:\n1)     While re-taking a course can improve your GPA this will only happen if you do better than you did the first time. If you end up with a lower grade in the re-take, then this will lower your GPA. The last taken grade is what counts towards the GPA.\n2)     The earlier grade will remain on your transcript, and will not disappear.\n3)     How have things changes since the first time you took the course? Have you improved your work load or study habits to give yourself a better opportunity for improving your grade?\nHow many courses / what grades do I need to raise my GPA?\nThis is a common question from students that are either attempting to graduate, are thinking of applying to graduate school, or are in academic jeopardy (e.g., conditional standing, failed standing) the best way to answer this question is to try out different course and grade scenarios to see how these may impact your GPA. We have made available a simple excel spreadsheet for this purpose (download link here).\n \nQUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO SPECIALIZATION STUDENTS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE OPTIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE COURSE (PSYC 485)\nWhen do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses?\nYou must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 485. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 485. Keep in mind that PSYC 485 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload.\nWhen do I take PSYC 485?\nPSYC 485 is an optional course for students in the specialization program who wish to have the opportunity to conduct research. You would apply to take this course in the summer before your final year after you have received your grades from the winter term. You must have a minumim GPA of 3.0, and a thesis supervisor to be admitted. A completed application form and a 'supervisor-student-contract' (both available on the department website in the FORMS section) must be submitted with your application.\nHow do I find a thesis supervisor?\nIt is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them. Be aware that there are a limited number of spots so register early!\nQUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO HONOURS.\nWhen do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses?\nYou must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 495. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 495. Keep in mind that PSYC 495 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload.\nWhen do I take PSYC 490, 491, and 495?\nThe Honours Seminars (PSYC 490, 491) and Honours Thesis Seminar (PSYC495) are taken in the final year of the honours program. To be able to register for these classes, you must have completed PSYC 311 and get permission from the department, which will be given once you have a confirmed thesis supervisor. You would take these courses in your final year provided your grades warrant your completing the honours program (have and maintain a minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA in PSYC courses, and 3.3 in all others).\nHow do I find a thesis supervisor?\nIt is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them. \nHow do I secure a place in PSYC 491, 492, and 495?\nThe honours advisor will open a place for you in a particular section after you let the advisor know, by email, which faculty member has agreed to be your research thesis supervisor, and the thesis supervisor confirms by email that you are accepted into the laboratory. If you are an Honours student, you do not have to complete the 'supervisor-student-contract' at this point (available on the department website in the FORMS section), as you will do so during the first week of the thesis class.\nWho can register me?\nYou register yourself once a place has been opened for you. You will receive an email, after registration begins, listing the specific sections to which you have been admitted.\nCan I pick a thesis / seminar section?\nNo. Students are assigned to a thesis / seminar section by the honours advisor. This procedure provides an even distribution of the number of thesis students and research topics across all sections.\nWhat if I don’t yet have confirmation of a place in the honours courses when my date for registration occurs?\nAll the seminar and thesis courses occur at the same time (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 16:15 pm to 18:45). With that schedule in mind, you can register for all your other courses when your date for registration occurs.\n \nFor career counselling, you should visit the Career and Placement Services Department .\nAcademic advisors provide advice about your academic program:\nwhich program you should be in;\nwhether your progress is satisfactory;\nwhat to do if you run into problems in your courses; and\nanswer questions about graduate school and academic opportunities following graduation.\nAdvising in the Department of Psychology is reserved exclusively for students currently enrolled in a Psychology program.\n \n"}

A noteworthy feature of our program is that clinical students may study applied problems (e.g., child or adult psychopathology; high risk populations; adjustment in aging; health psychology) in their research teams, or they may also study more theoretical problems with humans (e.g., cognitive, social, and developmental processes; information processing and social cognition) or animals (e.g., appetitive motivation; drugs, hormones, and behaviour; reproductive behaviour).\nBecause entering students often have had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, by the time they complete the PhD degree they have achieved a high level of research specialization, and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, many have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences.

In the first year, students with B.A. or B.Sc. degrees enter the Diploma in Clinical Psychology and the MA in Psychology. They conduct their master's thesis research, participate in research meetings in their area of specialization, and take courses in statistics/research design, psychological theory, psychopathology, and assessment. During the second year, students take courses in cognitive, behavioural, and other empirically supported treatments, receive practicum training in assessment and psychotherapy in the APC and, typically in the second summer, complete a full-time extramural clinical practicum. At the Ph.D. level, students also conduct their dissertation research, take advanced clinical and research seminars, participate in additional therapy practica, and write their Ph.D. comprehensive examinations. In the final year, students undertake a full-time, predoctoral internship (or two years half-time). Recent students have completed internships at a variety of mental health facilities across Canada and the United States.\n"}

Clients at the APC are seen by graduate students under the supervision of clinical faculty. The types of services offered by the APC reflect the interests of clinical supervisors and students, and may include individual, family, or marital psychotherapy, cognitive-behaviour therapy for anxiety or stress, and treatment of child disorders.\nExternal training facilities\nExtramural practica, as well as an accredited senior predoctoral internship ( Concordia University Psychology Internship Programme ) may be carried out in a variety of local hospital settings. Some of the local sites where clinical graduate students are typically placed for external practica include:\nMcGill Mental Health Service - Clinical Psychology Practicum and Internship Program\nThe McGill Mental Health Service offers advanced clinical practica and internships to graduate students in Ph.D. Clinical Psychology programs. Our team consists of Psychologists, Psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Practicum students and interns are an integral and valued part of our team and we offer a warm and supportive environment. Given the breadth and depth of our program, we provide an excellent training opportunity for those who eventually want to work in private practice. We provide short and long-term psychological treatment to the undergraduate and graduate population at McGill University. We also have an emergency walk-in service. The population is extremely diverse: we treat clients from different cultural backgrounds and ages. Clients present with a wide range of Axis I and Axis II disorders. Students applying to our program should have a strong interest in the area of Adult/Young Adult mental health.\nRoyal Victoria Hospital\nThe Royal Victoria Hospital is a general hospital setting. Within Psychology, there are four distinct training programs, each with its own set of supervisors, seminars and clinical experiences. These programs include Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Adult Services Psychology, Sex and Couple Therapy as well as Child/Adolescent Psychology.\nMontreal Neurological Institute and Hospital\nThis setting is a specialized care hospital in Neurology and the practicum in Psychology is neuropsychological in emphasis. Most patients are assessed in order to determine whether they are suitable candidates for neuro-surgery. A variety of psychomotor and cognitive tests are administered. Both English and French test batteries are used. Neuropsychological assessment is the focus. Clients served include inpatients, epileptic patients, OCD patients, tourette syndrome patients, etc. The ages of clients served range from teenagers to the elderly.\nDouglas Hospital\nThe Douglas Hospital is one of the largest Psychiatric Hospital Centres in Montreal. In addition to in-patients, the centre provides out-patient services through various community clinics and hospital units. It offers a wide range of clinics and services, which serve children, adolescents and adults. Orientations cover psychodynamic, systemic, cognitive, behavioural and psychoeducational.\nThe Montreal Children's Hospital\nThe Department of Psychology of The Montreal Children's Hospital offers summer practicum in pediatric and clinical child psychology. The program provides unique opportunities to apply child clinical skills to the prevention or management of psychological problems associated with physical disease or dysfunction. Situated in a major pediatric hospital setting, the practicum offers varied clinical experiences with children (0-18 years) and their families\nSir Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital\nThe SMBD Jewish General Hospital is a general hospital setting serving a wide variety of medical, psychiatric and out-patients. There are several units/services within Psychology that are offered as Practicum placements, primarily at level II. For example, Early Childhood Development Service; Child Psychiatry Day/Evening Hospital; Child and Adolescent (OPD); Youth Service (OPD: age 16-20); Adult Day Treatment; Adult In-Patient; Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; Couple and Family Therapy; Adult Rehabilitation Service (OPD); Neuropsychology. A range of theoretical orientations are available including Cognitive-Behavioural, Family Systems, and Psychodynamic.\nThe Montreal General Hospital\nThe Psychological Services places equal value on individual and group therapy modalities. Trainees are assigned to in-patients, out-patients and emergency room rotations. Equal time is given to Psychological Assessments and Therapeutic intervention activities. Trainees attend seminars and present at academic events. The orientation is Psychoanalytic/Psychodynamic.\nSt. Mary's Hospital\nSt. Mary's is a general hospital with a psychology service which is principally affiliated with the Department of Psychiatry. The center’s patient population is exclusively adult. The great majority of patients are referred from the outpatient psychiatric department or from family medicine. Trainees may conduct individual therapy or psychometric assessments to evaluate intellectual, memory, and perceptual-motor functions or to clarify diagnostic questions. The theoretical orientation of the center’s staff varies considerably, with some having a psychodynamic approach and others being more cognitive-behavioural or humanistic.\n"}

Au moyen de motifs fondamentaux, comme le bloc, le cercle et la bande, l’artiste évoque les diverses manières dont les êtres humains ont tenté de conceptualiser ou de décrire l’infini. Toutefois, les matériaux idiosyncrasiques utilisés contrarient, de manière imprévisible, les desseins métaphysiques de Surabhi Ghosh et celle-ci, en manipulant ces matériaux à la main, ne fait que révéler l’inéluctable finitude de l’être humain.\nCe regroupement d’œuvres fait référence à un certain nombre d’idées :\n~ Le problème géométrique et l’impossibilité métaphorique de la « quadrature du cercle »\n~ Les notions mathématiques d’« arrangement de cercles » dans un espace à deux dimensions et d’« arrangement de sphères » dans un espace à trois dimensions\n~ L’utilisation de rouleaux de tissu comme symbole d’abondance, d’aisance et de prospérité\n~ Les exemples dans la mythologie hindoue illustrant la relativité et le caractère infini de certains phénomènes, comme dans le cas du sari de Draupadi\n~ Le rangoli, un art populaire d’Asie du Sud fait à partir de farine et de sable colorés\n~ Les représentations de la philosophie hindoue dans l’iconographie et la langue.

Après plusieurs années à suivre les traces des premiers explorateurs vikings qui ont foulé le sol du Nouveau Monde, l’artiste s’est rendue au Groenland pour rejoindre une équipe d’archéologues danois œuvrant à la restauration des ruines des colonies nordiques les mieux préservées du monde. Dans ce paysage à mi-chemin entre l’Ancien et le Nouveau Monde, l’histoire se révèle au fil des strates qu’elle parcourt.

D’autres pierres ainsi détournées il y a longtemps de leur fonction initiale sont récupérées pour la restauration d’un site archéologique.\nQue signifie « restaurer une ruine »?

Le jour suivant, des émeutes ont éclaté et un mouvement social est alors né : Montréal-Nord Républik. Le meurtre de Fredy Villanueva a non seulement attisé le sentiment d’exclusion sociale et le mécontentement qui sommeillaient depuis des années, mais aussi mis en lumière les tactiques de surveillance policière actuelles, l’asymétrie des pouvoirs institutionnels et le profilage racial. Montréal-Nord existe sous l’œil des autorités. Caméras de sécurité et de surveillance, télévision en circuit fermé, applications Google Maps et Google Street View usent tous d’un regard descendant jeté par divers mécanismes institutionnels asymétriques, qui façonnent des perspectives verticales composites.

Véritables chorégraphies minimalistes, les œuvres adoptent des formes éclectiques mais éminemment sculpturales : enceintes acoustiques superposées, rideau conçu de centaines d’écouteurs-boutons ou système de sonorisation disséqué chirurgicalement. Pour réaliser ces étonnantes transfigurations, le créateur s’inspire de l’esthétique utilitaire.\nIci, les attentes concrètes en matière de production de sons se réinventent au rythme de l’enjolivement subtil d’un bruit inattendu ou du vacarme propre au poids du silence. Réorientés dans leur forme comme dans leur fonction, les objets s’inscrivent dans un vaste vocabulaire thématique.

Image courtesy of the artists.\nEN\nDonna Akrey and Yvette Poorter are a collaborative duo that have been making/continue to make work together when they can since the 1990s (or since they jumped off a cliff into Muskoka water at age 17). Their work is multi-media and often involves easily found and/or scavenged materials. They are interested in getting lost while realizing the rarity of such a thing. So they make work to get lost in. Poorter and Akrey have been collecting stories and images from people who have a dead dad. They use these snippets of other people’s memories, as fuel to create a morphing landscape installation. Yes, the exhibition is about dads—dead dads at that—but it is also a rumination on memory and the size and viscosity of memory. A vague longing.\nExposition\nDonna Akrey et Yvette Poorter\nDu 10 avril au 19 mai 2017\nFR\nDonna Akrey et Yvette Poorter collaborent, au gré de leur disponibilité, depuis les années 1990 (ou depuis qu’elles ont sauté d’une falaise dans les eaux de Muskoka à l’âge de 17 ans). Leur œuvre multimédia fait souvent appel à des matériaux facilement trouvés ou récupérés. Bien qu’elles souhaitent pouvoir se perdre, elles réalisent la rareté d’une telle possibilité et cherchent donc plutôt à se perdre dans leurs créations. Le duo recueille des récits et des images de personnes dont le père est mort. Elles se servent de ces fragments de souvenirs d’autrui pour concevoir une installation paysagère évolutive. L’exposition traite ainsi des pères – des pères disparus, qui plus est –, mais il s’agit également d’une rumination sur la mémoire, sur sa portée et sa viscosité.

Although we often think of political discourse as rational, literary sources are crucial to democratic politics as they can offer a civic education or way for citizens to think about and understand politics and political debates. Such literary sources are also essential to democratic discourse because they provide a way to engage in politics through critique and protest.\nTargeting experts from political science, English, comparative literature, classics, history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and the liberal arts, this workshop will identify crosscutting research areas which explore the important contribution of alternative epistemological approaches to understanding, promoting, and critiquing democratic practices. Within this theme, the one-day event will investigate the state of research on literary approaches to democratic political thought and identify key areas for future research. The long-term goal will result in an edited volume on the topic.\nFaculty and PhD Students should submit short abstracts of approximately 250 words.\nDeadline for proposal submissions: OCTOBER 10, 2016\nFor more information or to submit abstracts please contact:\n"}

In this workshop, Ms. Rempel will explore the demands on the Canadian government when managing immigration and challenges faced when coping with crises like that brought about in the Syrian refugee case. What has Canada done right? How can we improve in the future? And what might be done to strengthen immigration policy to create a safer, stronger, and better democracy for all current and future Canadians?\nJoin this lively discussion and find out more!\n"}

But for most university students, the coming weeks mean final exams , mounting stress and negative moods .\nWhile that doesn’t seem like an ideal combination for great grades, new Concordia research shows that the occasional bout of bad feelings can actually improve students’ academic success.\nA study published in Developmental Psychology by Erin Barker , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science , shows that students who were mostly happy during their four years of university but who also experienced occasional negative moods had the highest GPAs at the time of graduation.\nIn contrast, the study also confirmed that students who experienced high levels of negative moods and low levels of positive moods often ended up with the lowest GPAs — a pattern consistent with depressive disorders.\n“Students often report feeling overwhelmed and experiencing high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms,” says Barker, who is also a member of the Centre for Research in Human Development .\n“This study shows that we need to teach them strategies to both manage negative emotions and stress in productive ways, and to maintain positive emotional experiences.”\nFor the study, Barker and her co-authors* worked with 187 first-year students at a large university. The researchers tracked the students throughout their four years of schooling by having them complete questionnaires about recent emotional experiences each year, beginning in the first year and continuing throughout their undergraduate degree.\n \nNegative emotions signal a challenge\n“We looked at students’ response patterns to better understand how experiences of positive and negative emotions occurred over time. We then combined average patterns to look how each person varied from their own average and examined different combinations of trait and state affects together,” Barker explains.\n“This allowed us to identify the pattern associated with the greatest academic success: those who were happy for the most part, but who also showed bouts of elevated negative moods.”\nThese findings demonstrate that both negative and positive emotions play a role in our successes.\n“We often think that feeling bad is bad for us. But if you're generally a happy person, negative emotions can be motivating. They can signal to you that there is a challenge that you need to face. Happy people usually have coping resources and support that they draw on to meet that challenge.”\nIn January, Barker and psychology graduate students Sarah Newcomb-Anjo and Kate Mulvihill will expand on this research by launching a new study focused on life beyond graduation. Their plan: examine patterns of emotional experience and well-being as former students navigate new challenges associated with finding work or entering a post-graduation program.\n*Partners in research: This study was co-authored by Carsten Wrosch , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, Andrea L. Howard from Carleton University and Nancy L. Galambos from the University of Alberta. The research was funded by a grant awarded to N.

It's sponsored in part by Clinical Projects Grant from the Ordre régional des infirmières et infirmiers de Montréal/Laval, as well the CSU Special Projects fund. The CSU, Queer Concordia , Health Services and the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association (CUPA) are collaborating to run the testing events.\nTo choose from a variety of free condoms at the give-away, simply go to the Atrium of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) on the Sir George Williams Campus. You can always get free condoms at the weekly Healthy YOU at CU information table, or come by Health Services Condom Boutique where you can choose from a variety of condoms, \"3-for-$1\"!\n“The goal is to remind students that regular STI testing is a normal part of taking care of your health, just like going to the dentist,” says Gabriella Szabo, health promotion specialist with  Health Services . “And students get their results in 20 minutes, rather than 10 days.”\nBe informed and empowered\nDecember 1 is World Aids Day and a perfect occasion to have a clear-headed conversation about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). CATIE , a Canadian online source for information and resources about HIV and AIDS, is a good place to learn more about the history and contemporary reality of the disease.\nThe Concordia University Community Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS has its fourth event on December 1 from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Museum of Fine Arts. London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium.\nConsent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events.\nAt the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained: “We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,” she says.\n“Outreach activities like this are also great opportunities to start important conversations and provide information about consent, bystander intervention and preventing sexual violence.”\n \nLearn more about safe sex by reading Health Service’s 16 Safer Sex Practices .\n \n"}

At what age can children explain people’s behaviours as being guided by their mental states? Who do toddlers trust to teach them new things — and why?\nThese questions, and others like it, have been the focus of Diane Poulin-Dubois ’s research for the last 31 years at Concordia. The psychology professor from the Faculty of Arts and Science leads the Cognitive and Language Development Lab .\nOn October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award — the Prix Acfas Thérèse Gouin-Décarie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.\n“Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois’s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.\n“We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois’s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l’ACFAS (faculty award). She was also on the organizing committee when Concordia hosted the 2014 Acfas conference , “Research: Zones of Creativity and Convergence, ” welcoming 5,100 scholars and offering 173 colloquia.\nPrevious Acfas winners from the Concordia community include Michel Laroche , John Molson School of Business marketing professor, André Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, Sherry Simon , French professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science, Marguerite Mendell , professor and graduate program director for the School of Community and Public Affairs, and François-Marc Gagnon , founding director of the Gail and Stephen A.

She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.”\nThis career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.\n“We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.” Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example, “dog/chien”) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation.\nHer other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called “trust,” which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.\n“We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,” says Poulin-Dubois.\n“My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to? Then you can speculate how our species has evolved differently or similarly to others.”\nPraise from the department\nWilliam Bukowski , psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Centre for Research in Human Development , is thrilled that Acfas is recognizing Poulin-Dubois.\n“Diane has been at the forefront of understanding how the concepts that were popular in a Piagetian perspective can now be applied to other domains of functioning, such as bilingualism,” he says. \n“She is remarkable in her capacity to develop rigorous and very creative laboratory tests.”\nBukowski also points to Poulin-Dubois’s success as a supervisor.\nTwo of her graduate students, Cristina Crivello and Sabrina Chiarella, have won Graduate Research Communicator of the Year Awards for their papers on the benefits of bilingualism and early trust. “When your students win awards, it reflects well on everyone.

The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world.\nToday, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career.\nI grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education.\nWhen applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be “a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.”\nI had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade.\nThis allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students’ results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents.\nI have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died.\nMy hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.  \nOn Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution.\nThe government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years.\nI have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture “of the moment.” We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face.\nThe main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum — I am referring to those who did not participate.\nBut in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.\n \nFind out more about Concordia's Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it’s good for mind and body.\nIn fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood — but in markedly different ways.\nThe researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.\n“We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,” says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study’s lead author.\nIn particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain’s two hemispheres — in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.\n“This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,” Giacosa explains. “Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.”\n‘This work has major potential’\nInterestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field.\nAccording to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other. “Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.”\nVirginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study’s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.\n“This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,” Penhune says. “Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.”\nSome studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.\n“Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson’s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,” says Penhune.\n*Partners in research: The co-authors of this study — Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J. Karpati, Nicholas E.V. Foster, Virginia Penhune, and principal investigator Krista L. Hyde — are all members of the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research.

In 2015–16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity .\nThe series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.\n“Last year really exceeded our expectations,” says André Roy , dean of FAS. “So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.”\nOn Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season, “ Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,” invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations.\nHeld in collaboration with Concordia’s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes .\nAccording to Roy, this year’s series won’t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A. “We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.”\nClaudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public.\nGauthier’s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age. “I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,” she explains.\n‘Thinking outside the box’\nFellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.\n“I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,” says Chapman. “I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.”\nAnother first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the “Come to your senses” event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .\n“I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,” explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .\n“I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.”\nRoy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.\n“We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats.

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.\n“Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in — even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,” says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.\n“Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.”\n \nHormones influence problem-solving\nFor the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a “hormonal profile” questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits.\nThe participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways.\nAt the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end.\nResults were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks.\nThat proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks — such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words — depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle.\nEssentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.\n“This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,” says Brake.\n“For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones”\n'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain'\nFor recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study’s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.\n“Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants — and male rats — in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,” she says.\n“I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.”\n"}

His tireless work has enabled us to recruit outstanding faculty of international quality, attract top-quality students and postdocs and emerge as an important new partner in the Quebec and Canadian landscape of health research.\n“I am proud of and grateful for everything that Louis has given to Concordia. He is a true leader. I know I am not alone in being sad at his decision to move over the mountain, but I am very eager to pursue new collaborations as he embarks on the next phase of his astonishing career.”\nFor his part, Bherer is proud of what the PERFORM research team has been able to accomplish over the last four years. “We’ve laid the foundation for our mission of advancing research, education and community engagement while offering unique opportunities for new discoveries in preventive health research,” he says.\n“With the support and guidance of the exceptional team of researchers, students and staff we have established, PERFORM will continue to blossom in the years to come.”\nLooking forward, Carr is extremely pleased that PERFORM will be in safe hands under the leadership of Habib Benali, given the scope of his international research and administrative portfolio, his extraordinary connections with the health research community in Montréal and his commitment to the institutional vision for PERFORM.\n“We are unbelievably fortunate that a person of Habib’s calibre and experience is poised to accept the interim scientific director position,” says Carr. “As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM’s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.”\nBenali’s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position.\nPrior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Université de Montréal.\nBenali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM — part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University — until 2015.\nHe looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,” he says. “I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.”\nCarr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia’s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.\n \n"}

People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,” says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.*\nEvery second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year — the denouement, if you will.\nEthnodramas and 100 original songs\n“The theme of our show is 'We Can',” says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director. “The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.”\nPart of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist.\nThe CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas — plays based on the performers' lived experiences — as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.\n \nStephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience. “Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.”\nGoulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. “They always want me to come back, and I never say no.”\n‘Taking everyone for who they are’\nChoreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga .\nSanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.\n“It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,” she says. “They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.”\nFrom the stage to the big screen\nThe Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .\n“When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,” says Snow.\nBecause the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale.\nCrafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase.\nGet your tickets today for the Centre for the Arts in Human Development retrospective show, A Night at the Oscar , taking place June 17 and 18 at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall.\n*The Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health recognizes individuals or organizations for building awareness of mental health issues in the community through research, service, advocacy, combatting stigma or calling the public’s attention to the needs of family caregivers.

Just like Pavlov’s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink.\nIndeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .\n“Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,” says Nadia Chaudhri , the study’s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .\n“Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.”\nThe results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them.\nAccording to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn’t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.\n“Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,” Chaudhri explains.\n“These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.”\nFor the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol — the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks.\nThe researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue.\nThis happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered.\nThe researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable.\nSo how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?\n“Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,” says Chaudhri. “By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.”\nShe explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.\n“This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,” says Chaudhri.\n“Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.”\nChaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.\nRead the cited study here , led by Nadia Chaudhri, professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology . \n \n"}

At least one in four Canadians will have an anxiety disorder in their lifetime.\nWhile effective therapies for these often-debilitating disorders exist, many sufferers find them very difficult to engage with or complete. This prompted researchers at Concordia to look for ways to make treatment easier to handle for those who need it most.\nIn studies recently published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders and forthcoming in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Concordia psychology researchers Hannah Levy and Adam Radomsky show that the very behaviours people use to avoid anxiety could become part of an effective treatment, and that patients have a significant role to play in deciding when those behaviours are no longer necessary.\nRadomsky and Levy focus on safety behaviours — things people do to make themselves feel less anxious. Examples include wearing gloves when touching dirty objects, avoiding eye contact during stressful interactions, distracting yourself when doing something scary — any behaviour that increases feelings of safety in anxiety-provoking situations.\n“Traditionally, psychologists thought that fading out or eliminating these behaviours entirely should be the primary focus of the therapy used to combat anxiety disorders. But we found that changing those behaviours and giving patients greater agency is much more effective,” says Radomsky, professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology and senior author of the studies.\nHe and Levy followed 157 study participants — ranging from people with low-level anxieties to those diagnosed OCD — as they adapted old habits with new ones that they could use to avoid anxiety during exposure therapy, in which the therapist exposes the patient to feared objects or situations without any danger.\nThe researchers found that using new safety behaviours during exposure therapy was slightly more helpful to participants than their usual or typical safety behaviours.\nThey also found that the most important aspect of reducing the use of safety behaviours in therapy is that the client or patient be the one who decides when they are ready to move forward without them. \n“This is different from the standard approach in which therapists encourage people to drop their safety behaviours at the outset of the therapy, which often leads people to drop out or refuse the treatment. Under the right conditions, safety behaviours have the potential to make the therapy more effective, and more acceptable,” explains Levy, who recently defended her PhD in psychology at Concordia and will graduate this summer.\nRadomsky, who also holds a Concordia University Research Chair in Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the results of the research could help therapists shape their approach to best help each person with whom they’re working.\n“It’s our hope that these findings will help to reduce the number of people who refuse or drop out of cognitive behavioural therapies and should result in more people getting the help that they need.”\nPartners in research: These studies were supported in part by the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\nFind out more about clinical and health research in the Concordia Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

This year’s theme is “Bioimaging for Prevention and Health Research,” and will include presentations on brain imaging, body composition, medical and musculoskeletal imaging.\nWhy bioimaging?\n“The timing is right for this topic because of significant developments at PERFORM this year,” says  Karen Li , chair of the PERFORM Centre’s Scientific Events and Communications Committee and a professor in the Department of Psychology .\n“Our imaging suite recently opened, and we recently welcomed Habib Benali, PERFORM’s new associate scientific director of biomedical engineering. It’s quite a coup for Concordia to have Professor Benali here given his international reputation.”\nAt the conference, Benali and PERFORM research member Jean-Paul Soucy will be showcasing current imaging projects led by PERFORM members.\nThe conference's international list of guest speakers  includes: Pedro Antonio Valdes-Sosa from Cuba, Kirsi A. Virtanen from Finland, Alan Evans from Montreal, Julie Hides from Australia, Timothy J. Hall and Shen from the USA.\n“Their lectures will cover a wide range of subjects because bioimaging has such a diverse application. We have someone talking about elite athletes and astronauts, someone talking about neuro-degeneration and another talking about image-based biomarkers,” says Li.\nBioimaging and obesity research\nBioimaging is a relevant public health topic, Li says, “because it helps with early diagnosis.”\nWhich brings us back to Shen’s research on obesity.\n“Recent advances in MRI and MRS made it possible to quantify total body and regional fat, to map fat tissue distribution and to evaluate fat in places like the liver and pancreas,” she explains.\n“The digitalization and centralization of these images allowed for clarifying obesity-related questions in various diseases. Imaging offers enormous opportunities in obesity care and prevention in diseases.”\nNew methodology workshop\nOn Friday, May 20, the day after the bioimaging conference, the PERFORM Centre will host its first Methodological Workshop in Imaging at Concordia’s Loyola Campus, with a theme of “Longitudinal Analysis with Neuroimaging Data.”\nThe workshop provides an opportunity to learn new methods special to longitudinal neuroimaging studies. There will be a series of five talks from experts who will introduce longitudinal studies involving different neuroimaging modalities (MRI, fMRI, PET, EEG), while focusing on specific methods to analyse that data.\nGood prognosis\nTo date, more than 200 people are registered to attend the annual conference and learn more about how bioimaging can serve preventive healthcare.\nWill they be comparing their BMIs? Not likely.\nThe third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference begins at 7:45 a.m. on Thursday, May 19. The Methodological Workshop in Imaging begins at 9 a.m. on Friday, May 20.\nOnline registration for both events is closed, but it is still possible to register on site.\n \n"}

What is it with the number 13? | Photo by Angela Rutherford (Flickr CC)\nMeagan Boisse is a journalism undergraduate. She currently writes A Concordian abroad , a column about her term at the Danish School of Media and Journalism.\nTomorrow is Friday the 13th, commonly accepted as the unluckiest day of the year for anyone who isn’t a serial killer .\nWhile many scoff at the superstitious occasion, some 17 to 21 million people in the United States reportedly suffer from \"friggatriskaidekaphobia,\"  the clinical term for being spooked by this most freaky of Fridays.\nWhy are we afraid?\nIn 2004, the North Carolina Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute estimated the United States loses $800 to 900 million in business on Fridays that coincide with the 13th day of the month, as superstitious consumers are too terrified to go about their daily lives.\n“You just need enough people talking about something in a scary enough way to then become apprehensive about it yourself,” says Adam Radomsky , a professor of psychology at Concordia . “Once that happens it’s very easy not only to worry, but also to tie all minor negative events that could happen at any given time to the superstition.”\nValérie De Courville Nicol , a professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology , says society’s need for control and catharsis is part of Friday the 13th.\n“I think that in contemporary culture we have a particularly strong fear of anything that is uncertain, uncontrollable and unpredictable,” she says.\n“We live in a control-oriented culture, so we don't have much tolerance for irrational phenomena. It's almost as if this day is a culturally legitimate day during which people can express the feelings they can't let themselves express normally. It’s a ritualized relationship that has a function in allowing people to put their fears somewhere.”\nBut De Courville Nicol believes that being afraid is not always a bad thing.\n“You can understand it from a psychological perspective as an irrational fear, but many of the fears that we share in common as a group help produce our identity and our feeling of belonging.” \nThe origin of Friday the 13th\nFolklorists aren’t exactly sure where the most feared date in history comes from . No written evidence for the superstition exists prior to the 19th century.\nThe working theory is that Friday the 13 is actually the product of two separate fears working in tandem. The first is the fear of the number 13 , and the second is the Christian-rooted superstition that Fridays are unlucky, stemming from the belief that it was the day of Crucifixion.\nAs far as the number 13 goes, people have seemingly always been wary of it. Even the Babylonians omitted it from their Code of Hammurabi . Numerologists suspect this could be because it is an outlier of the number 12, thought to be the representation of completeness and perfection.\nThink about it: 12 apostles of Christ, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 gods of Olympus, 12 zodiac signs, 12 months in a year, 12 hours on the clock.\nThe number has also been spoiling dinner parties for the last few millennia. It is believed that if 13 people dine together, at least one will die within the year. This harkens back to biblical times, as Judas was the 13th person to sit at Christ’s table for the last supper — and we all know how that turned out.\nFun fact: in the 1880s a society, dubbed the Thirteen Club , was formed to dispel the aforementioned superstition. Members threw 13-people dinner parties on the 13th of every month, and liked to walk under ladders.\nFive U.S. presidents were honorary members: Chester Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

For example, when a transplant recipient thinks they inherited traits of the donor.\n“People the world over are essentialist thinkers,” he said. “They are attracted to the idea that hidden essences make things as they are. And because genetic concepts remind people of essences, they tend to think of genes in ways similar to essences. That is, people tend to think about genetic causes as immutable, deterministic, homogenous, discrete and natural.”\nHeine went on to examine how essentialist biases lead people to think differently about sex, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), crime, eugenics and disease whenever these are described in genetic terms.\n“Our essentialist biases make people vulnerable to the sensationalist hype that has emerged with the genomic revolution and access to direct-to-consumer genotyping services,” concluded Heine, who recommends more genetic education for the general public to reduce essentialist thinking and counteract the idea that genetic causes are inevitable.\nFind out more about the  Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

What better time to celebrate Concordians working in the field of sleep research?\nLooking at everyone from children to the elderly, Concordia’s researchers are studying the patterns, influences and consequences of sleep.\nJennifer McGrath: stress and sleep\n“My research focuses on how sleep impacts heart health and obesity in children — specifically, why poor families have poor health,” says Jennifer McGrath , associate professor in the Department of Psychology and Concordia’s inaugural PERFORM Chair in Childhood Preventive Health and Data Science. \"The stress of being poor gets under their skin, literally, and stress seems to make its biggest impact while we're sleeping.\"\nHere, at the 2015 Chancellor’s Builders Dinner, McGrath’s discusses how sleep is critical for good health:\n&amp;nbsp;\nA new study from September 2015, led by researchers Jinshia Ly, McGrath and Jean-Philippe Gouin from Concordia’s Centre for Clinical Research in Health (CCRH) and the PERFORM Centre , shows that poor sleep might explain how stress impacts health in kids.\n“Getting a good night’s sleep might buffer the impact of stress on kids’ cortisol level, which is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland to regulate the body’s cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems,” says McGrath, also the director of Concordia’s Pediatric Public Health Psychology (PPHP) Laboratory . “Long-term exposure to cortisol can put people at risk for health problems, like heart diseases, weight gain and depression.”\nThis study was part of the larger, ongoing Healthy Heart Project directed by McGrath. It was made possible by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Operating Grant awarded to McGrath and the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé bourse de formation maîtrise awarded to Ly. The CIHR funding was renewed and the project is funded until 2020.\nThanh Dang-Vu: ageing and sleep\nWhat is the relationship between sleep and cognition in older adults?\nNeurologist Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor in the Department of Exercise Science, is currently recruiting people over the age of 65 for a sleep study to get some answers. \nThanh Dang-Vu: “Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases.”\n“Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases,” says Dang-Vu, Concordia Research Chair in Sleep, Neuroimaging and Cognitive Health at Concordia’s Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology and the PERFORM Centre, is also a medical doctor at the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal .\n“In the general population, chronic insomnia, which is insomnia for more than three months, is about 10 to 15 per cent. In the elderly, people older than 65, insomnia rates can be between 30 and 34 per cent, or one third of the population — at least double that of younger people,” he says. \nThat's a problem, Dang-Vu explains, because the population is more fragile. Insomniacs have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Too often, insomnia is treated with sleeping pills and patients become dependent.\nCognition concerns\n“We’ve recruited 20 participants over 65 years of age who take benzodiazepines — like Ativan, Klonopin and Serax, for example — to spend the night at our sleep lab,” says Dang-Vu, who won the 2015 Roger Broughton Young Investigator Award from the  Canadian Sleep Society  in recognition of his significant early career contributions to the field of sleep research in Canada.\n“We’re offering them a treatment called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),” says Dang-Vu, who wants to see if CBTI will improve their cognition.\n“If that's the case, it would emphasize the importance of treating insomnia for maintaining good cognitive function with age,” he says. “With age, we have a larger risk of developing memory problems. Sleep might be one of these aspects that help prevent the development of dementia. It’s important to look at that.”\nThe study is funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé and the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal.\nFor more information about Thanh Dang-Vu’s sleep lab, visit the Facebook page.\nTo participate in Dang-Vu’s sleep study, contact study coordinator Caroline Desrosiers at 514-340-3540, ext. 4790, or email caroline.desrosiers@criugm.qc.ca .\n \n"}

Her lab — which studies fear, reward and memory — is a Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) project with a total value of approximately $375,000 (including cash contributions from Québec's Ministère de l'Éducation et de l'Enseignement supérieur and from Concordia, and in-kind contributions from equipment suppliers).\nWhat is the goal of your research?\nMihaela Iordanova: The research in my lab focuses on understanding the behavioural and neural mechanisms that guide learning about the world around us. We seek to understand what neural circuits are involved in how we come to expect rewarding or fearful events, as well as how we update these expectations in our dynamic environments.\nUpdated memories can be fickle and subject to disruption, so we aim to develop ways to strengthen such recent memories. Sometimes, the stimuli that we base our expectations on are complex mnemonic events, which combine cues from diverse modalities such as a particular place or time. Our work also seeks to understand the nature of such complex memories.\nWhat do you hope will be the impact on society and your field of study?\nMI: Our work examines both fear and reward, and we hope to integrate and better understand the interaction between these opposing motivational states.\nWe seek to uncover which circuits, as opposed to individual brain areas, process reward and fear, as well as provide a novel understanding of their interaction behaviourally and neutrally, something that has remained largely elusive but has attracted much interest in recent times.\nIndeed, exaggeration in the processing of rewarding events translates to similar exaggerated processing of aversive events, and this has been linked to addiction.\nThe paradigms we use in our work represent animal models of psychopathologies such as addiction, obesity and anxiety. Examining the integration of fear and reward will provide a novel take on the psychological and neural mechanisms of these conditions. Ultimately, we hope to establish behavioural paradigms, which can inform and lead to the development of novel treatments for addiction, obesity and anxiety.\nNow that you've won a Canada Research Chair (CRC), what next steps do you hope to take? \nMI: The CRC will allow the lab to continue our research on fear and reward, but will also provide us with a way to delve into these questions using advanced optogenetic, pharamacogenetic and real-time neural recording techniques.\nThis provides a means to elucidate the neural mechanisms of reward and fear from the cell to the circuit level. Our lab will push the boundaries of the neurobiology of fear and reward expectation, as well as memory formation by integrating theoretical stipulations of learning with neural techniques that prod brain function in real time and examine how alterations in brain function influence information processing.\nFind out more about the Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

Their parents consistently report greater stress levels, caregiving burden and depression than parents of typically developing children.\nChronic caregiving stress has also been associated with poorer physical health — more pain, more disruptions from physical-health problems and lower overall health-related quality of life.\nOne powerful way to reduce their stress: social support. That’s according to a new study published in Family Relations by researchers from Concordia.\nAnd that support is essential as children — and their parents — age. It could also have important consequences for health costs.\nFor the study, psychology professors Jean-Philippe Gouin and Erin T. Barker , as well as their co-authors, investigated whether social support can protect against stress-induced immune problems.\nThey asked 56 healthy parents of children with ASD to complete questionnaires on formal social support (provided by health or social services professionals), informal social support (provided by significant others, friends and family) as well as self-rated health and recent somatic symptoms.\nStudy participants also provided blood samples to check for inflammation — the automatic reaction of the innate immune system upon exposure to infection, injury or abnormal cells, or psychological stress. Chronic low-grade inflammation is also associated with greater risk for several age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, frailty, dementia and early mortality.\nThe results indicated that greater informal social support was associated with lower inflammation, and that a higher number of formal support services received by the family was related to better self-rated health and lower inflammation.\nNotably, the impact of support services on the parents’ inflammation levels increased with the age of the affected child.\n“The impact of chronic caregiving stress on health likely becomes more pronounced as the parents are aging and their immune system responds less efficiently to challenges,” says Gouin. “The need for formal and informal support thus remains high even as the child with ASD is becoming an adult.”\nHe adds that the study results emphasize the need for continued services for these families, who are experiencing lifelong parenting challenges.\n“Given the reciprocal relationship between child and parental health and well-being, supporting the parents in coping with chronic caregiving stress might not only improve the child’s outcome, but also may help maintain an optimal family environment for a longer period of time. Supporting the parents in providing care to their children with ASD might then represent a cost-effective strategy in the long-term.” \nGouin is now continuing this research by following families during their ASD-affected children’s last years of high school and the first few years after graduation to examine the impact of social support services on parental health.\nCurrently, 120 families are participating, but Gouin hopes to recruit 100 more in the next two years.

Ryder\nIs Denmark the happiest country in the world? | Photo by Giuseppe Milo (Flickr CC)\nAccording to the 2016 World Happiness Report , Denmark is (once again) the happiest country in the world, and thus we should study their society closely to see what they're doing right ... But is it that simple?\nHere, Andrew G. Ryder , associate professor and director of clinical training in Concordia’s Department of Psychology , evaluates the methodology behind the fourth edition of the global survey and shines a light on how metrics and indices are at play:\nFor millennia, philosophers, theologians and many others have argued about what constitutes the “good life.”\nWhile some thinkers have emphasized objective markers, particularly economic indicators, others have advocated a broader view that encompasses personal and/or collective well-being. Aristotle’s eudaimonia is not merely happiness as maximizing positive emotions, but encompasses wisdom, personal virtue and so on. Social scientists have joined the fray in recent decades.\nBeyond the GDP\nThe rankings, and the accompanying report, have several advantages. First, the coverage of the study is impressive, and considers most countries in the world — ranging from Denmark (top rank) to Burundi (bottom rank).\nSecond, the resulting index and rankings help move the debate beyond economic indicators. This encourages societies to evaluate policies in terms of their impact on the well-being of their citizens, not merely on whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increased.\nOf course, it may well be good to increase GDP, but we could then judge the benefits of such an increase in terms of their impact on human-centred goals, rather than treating economy-centred goals as ends in themselves.\nThird, the approach taken in this survey was to ask respondents to rank their relative position on a 10-rung ladder from “the best possible life for you” down to “the worst possible life for you.” This method is a marked improvement from older cross-national surveys that used rating scales to measure “happiness” levels.\nFourth, the end results are easy to understand, communicate and discuss, helping to fuel a debate about what really matters both within and across different societies.\nAssumptions behind the numbers \nMy major concern with these kinds of studies — with the straightforward presentation of national \"league tables\" and their seeming ease of interpretation — is that there are a lot of assumptions buried in these numbers. The authors themselves do an admirable job of covering many concerns, exceptions, interpretive challenges and so on in their report — but the number of people who will read the report will surely be dwarfed by the number of people who read the news coverage and quickly look up their own country’s standing.\nBut is happiness actually the end goal against which we would want to evaluate all other goals? What if certain kinds of wisdom make us less happy, but better in other ways? What if happiness within a country is boosted at the expense of happiness in a neighbouring country, or if present happiness is being boosted at the expense of future generations?\nComplicating matters further, it’s not entirely clear that happiness is the best word to use. Unlike many previous studies, the word happiness is not actually used in the main task, which assesses self-perceived quality of life.\nThis approach represents a methodological advance in many ways, but it does complicate the interpretation: the jump to happiness, to the high arousal positive emotional state signified by the English word “happiness” is not straightforward.\nCross-national comparisons\nThese kinds of problems are inevitably compounded by cross-national comparisons, especially when people shaped by different cultural contexts respond to the task in different ways. For example, is it possible to raise people’s self-perceived quality of life by lowering expectations, so that one’s vision of “the best possible life for you” is constrained?\nIn my field of cultural psychology, we have learned that cross-national comparisons are hampered by the \"reference group effect\" where people in different cultural contexts respond to rating scales by comparing themselves with their perception of average people living in their own local environment.\nCultural psychologists have also found that people in different cultural contexts vary in terms of which emotional states are most desirable in the first place: whereas many Americans place a premium on “the pursuit of happiness,” many people living in East Asian societies show a marked preference for low arousal positive emotions such as “tranquility.” There is even evidence from Russia showing that people can even value negative emotions as more useful, as more authentic, as part of a richly lived life.\nBeware of national stereotypes about emotions\nAnother problem with these sorts of cross-national analyses is that subgroup differences are masked. I can just about believe a single score to represent Luxembourg, but what does a single score for China or India even mean? Should we really average Tibet’s happiness into China’s overall score? These are vast countries with considerable regional diversity, not to mention ethnic, religious, urban-rural and many other important distinctions.\nTo be fair, the authors are admirably clear about this issue, noting that there are wide discrepancies across various groups within each country. But the average reader is likely to miss these points and focus instead on the rankings.\nWe are then a short distance from aggregate “happiness” scores to national stereotypes about emotions. A conclusion such as: “Denmark’s sociocultural, political, and economic situation has helped it to become a country where many people rate themselves as at or close to the best life they can imagine for themselves,” becomes: “Danes are the happiest people in the world!”\nAlternate indices, different results \nSo I am pleased to see that this ambitious study is helping to move the discussion about national priorities beyond GDP, but hope the discussion continues to move beyond happiness rankings.\nRemember, we could change the survey question to reflect a different view of happiness, or change the criteria to yield different rankings. We could decide that societies should be judged on the happiness of the poorest 10 per cent, or the happiness of the most disadvantaged demographic subgroup or the ratio of happiness to environmental footprint, etc.\nThere are numerous alternative indices that could help get us beyond GDP, each one with particular assumptions, and each one of which would yield somewhat different results.\n \n"}

In Canada, that’s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky.\nEnter the iPad: a technological device that’s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and — according to new research from Concordia  — is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices.\nA study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment.\nAnd that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled.\nFor the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading.\nThe researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants’ visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.\n“Unsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,” says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia’s Department of Psychology and the study’s first author.\n“What was interesting to note was that it didn’t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),” he says.\n“When we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.”\nAnother benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.\n“Tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,” says Aaron Johnson , the study’s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR). \n“What’s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls — and they cost less than the traditional devices,” he says. “This cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.”\nPartners in research: This work was supported in part by the Vision Health Research Network, the Fonds de recherche du Québéc - Santé, the Antoine Turmel Foundation, CRIR, and the MAB-Mackay Foundation.

But are there hidden benefits to being bilingual? Research from Concordia reveals a new perk visible in the problem-solving skills of toddlers.\nThe results of a study recently published by the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology show that bilingual children are better than monolinguals at a certain type of mental control, and that those children with more practice switching between languages have even greater skills.\nBilingual speakers can thank the sometimes-arduous practice of switching from one language to another for this skill. “This switching becomes more frequent as children grow older and as their vocabulary size increases,” says Diane Poulin-Dubois, a professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology and the study’s senior author.\n“Therefore, the superior performance on these conflict tasks appears to be due to bilinguals’ strengthened cognitive flexibility and selective attention abilities as they have increased experience in switching across languages in expressive vocabulary.”\nPoulin-Dubois and Cristina Crivello, a graduate student with Concordia’s Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH), led a group of researchers* in a longitudinal investigation, which compared bilingual toddlers to their monolingual peers, tracking the tots as they gained greater vocabularies in each of their two languages.\nFor the study, the researchers assessed the vocabularies of 39 bilingual children and 43 monolinguals when they were aged 24 months, and then again at 31 months. During the second assessment, the researchers also had the young participants perform a battery of tasks to test their cognitive flexibility and memory skills.\n“For the most part, there was no difference between the bilingual and monolingual toddlers,” says Poulin-Dubois, who is also a member of CRDH. “But that changed dramatically when it came to the conflict inhibition test, and the differences were especially apparent in the bilingual toddlers whose vocabulary had increased most.”\nIn this case, conflict inhibition refers to the mental process of overriding a well learned rule that you would normally pay attention to.\nTo assess toddlers’ abilities in this domain, Crivello, who undertook the research as part of her master’s thesis and is the first author of the study, administered two tests:\nReverse categorization — participants were told to put a set of little blocks into a little bucket and big blocks into a big bucket. Then the instructions were switched — big blocks in the little bucket and little blocks in the big bucket.\nShape conflict — participants were shown pictures of different sized fruit and asked to name them. Then a new series of images was shown, with a small fruit embedded inside a large one. Toddlers were asked to point to the little fruit.\nIt wasn’t surprising to the researchers that the bilingual children performed significantly better on the conflict inhibition tasks than did their monolingual counterparts.\n“Language switching underlies the bilingual advantage on conflict tasks,” says Crivello. “In conflict inhibition, the child has to ignore certain information — the size of a block relative to a bucket, or the fact that one fruit is inside another. That mirrors the experience of having to switch between languages, using a second language even though the word from a first language might be more easily accessible.”\nThe unique feature of the study was the finding that the more language switching toddlers engaged in, the more it benefitted them. Within the bilingual group of toddlers, those who had amassed a greater number of “doublets” — pairs of words in each language, such as dog/chien — performed even better on the conflict inhibition tasks.\n“By the end of the third year of life, the average bilingual child uses two words for most concepts in his or her vocabulary, so young bilingual children gradually acquire more experience in switching between languages,” says Poulin-Dubois.\n*Partners in research: This research was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The study’s additional co-authors are Olivia Kuzyk and Monyka Rodrigues (Concordia University), Margaret Friend (San Diego State University) and Pascal Zesiger (Université de Genève).\n"}

The challenge for Booij is to better understand how stresses during pregnancy and in the first years of life may lead to unwelcome changes via serotonin and other neurotransmitters.\n“We know from animal work that environmental factors can influence your neurochemicals, in utero and in childhood,\" Booij says.\nIt is important to note that external stresses \"don't mean a person is stuck for life,” she adds. “There are many ways to compensate — you're not doomed to depression for example.\"\nConsequences may be modified, if not reversed, by, for instance, sound parenting, she says. A positive and enriching environment for an infant may help to compensate for perinatal stresses and early childhood adversity to the brain's development.\n\"We would expect from animal work that brain plasticity can take place: the brain is prone to change by environmental factors,” Booij says. “There is some evidence that some damage can be compensated for.\"\nShe's studying the genes that regulate serotonin, but also those linked to other neurotransmitters, as well as to hormones and biochemicals that affect human brain development and behaviour.\nHer work involves neuro-imaging, and PERFORM, on the Loyola Campus, has equipment for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning.\n\"With this equipment we can look at the structure of the brain and how it responds to certain stimuli, and look at specific neurotransmitters.\"\nIt's a complicated and important field. \"In the long term my research, a better understanding of early brain development, might help develop treatment, prevention and intervention programs for at-risk populations.\"\nFind out more about research at the PERFORM Centre .\n \n"}

That’s the fundamental question behind Poppy Wilkinson's proposal to the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships program .\nPoppy Wilkinson: “My interests have always been about people –– how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world.”\nWilkinson, a Concordia MA and first-year PhD student in the university's  Department of Psychology , now has the financial support to focus on finding the answer.\nShe landed the research scholarship in 2014 and, after a brief deferral, is now  joining Concordia's three 2015 Vanier recipients .\nThe Government of Canada launched the Vanier program in 2008 to strengthen the country’s ability to attract and retain world-class doctoral students, and establish Canada as a global centre of excellence in research and higher learning. \nAnnually, 167 Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships are awarded to national and international students. Winners receive $50,000 each, for three years.\nNarcissism, interrupted\nThe official title of Wilkinson's project is “The Social Consequences of Self-Distortions During Early Adolescence: A Cross-Cultural Perspective.”\n“I’ll be studying the social functioning of early adolescents who see themselves more positively than is objectively warranted,” she says. “This kind of distortion in self-concept is known as narcissism.”\nShe clarifies that she isn’t studying the narcissistic personality disorder found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n“I’m looking at what they call 'childhood normal narcissism.' While in the past, narcissism has been considered a disorder, recently it has also come to be understood as a normal-range individual difference.”\nNarcissism is characterized by a self-view that is at once grandiose and fragile, as it is highly contingent on the validation of others. It is associated with a host of negative behaviours including impulsivity, aggression, increased risk taking and exploitation, as well as unstable interpersonal relationships.\n“Surprisingly little is known about how narcissism functions in adulthood or childhood, particularly with respect to social experiences and peer groups,” adds Wilkinson.\n“In the literature, narcissism is usually assessed with self-report measures, but because narcissism plays out in the social realm, the perspective of peers is also important and interesting.”\n3 research goals\nWilkinson's research comprises a three-part project concerning the social consequences of childhood normal narcissism in 10-to-12-year-olds in Canada, the Netherlands and Colombia.\nShe’ll be working out of the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory , which is also known as the Bukowski Lab, in reference to William Bukowski , a psychology professor at Concordia. It’s part of the Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH) .\nWilkinson’s three research goals are:\n1. To clarify the association between narcissism, social validation and aggression\n2. To better understand the social status of children high in narcissism\n3. To explore cultural variations in adolescents' self-concept, and how these children function in their diverse social worlds\n“The results could lead to practical implications for educational settings,” says Wilkinson. “Some children benefit from initiatives aimed to boost self-esteem, but other children who feel superior may benefit from a different kind of intervention.”\nFrom English lit to psychology\nHow did Wilkinson go from a BA in English literature to pursuing her PhD in psychology?\n“My interests have always been about people –– how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world, why they do the things they do and what consequences this has for them and for those around them,” she says.\n“Analyzing the complex patterns and themes of human behavior is what attracted me to earn a bachelor’s degree in English literature with a minor in socio-cultural anthropology. Indeed, a key element of any good story lies in how an individual’s life history intersects with his or her social and cultural context.”\nIt is these same core interests that drew Wilkinson to research peer relations in developmental psychology and, more specifically, cross-cultural individual differences in self-concept.\n"}

Clarke Theatre and are free of charge, although registration is required .\nEach talk will explore an aspect of connecting — for health and wellness, through the games we play and in the science and technology we use every day. These conversations will challenge the way we think about how we share our world.\nThe Walrus Talks series brings Concordia faculty together with Canadian intellectuals in a series of seven-minute discussions on designated topics.\nIf you’re in Calgary, Ottawa or Toronto, watch for The Walrus Talks Health (Calgary, March 21), The Walrus Talks The Future (Ottawa, April 21) and (back by popular demand) The Walrus Talks Vice (Toronto, April 27).  More details to follow soon.\n“Both the Walrus Talks series and The Globe and Mail conversations offer great opportunities for us to engage our leading academics with thought leaders on subjects that are of interest to the public,” says Graham Carr, vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.\nConcordia and The Globe and Mail present the 2016 Conversations\nJanuary 28: Games, Ethics and How We Connect\nClive Thompson , author of Smarter Than You Think: How Technology is Changing Our Minds for the Better, joins Concordia’s Mia Consalvo , a professor in the Department of Communication Studies and Canada Research Chair in Game Studies and Design, for a conversation on how games help us connect socially, the ethics of communications technologies and the impact of online activities on our off-line lives.\nFebruary 11: Connecting and Wellness — Your Brain Matters\nSusan Pinker , author of The Village Effect: Why Face-to-face Contact Matters, and Concordia’s William Bukowski , a professor in the Department of Psychology , will discuss the importance of physical contact in a time of disbanded families and virtual connections. They’ll look at how our biology is affected by feeling and why connecting with others matters.\nMarch 1: Connecting Your Tech Future — A Conversation About What’s Next\nNora Young , broadcaster and author of The Virtual Self: How Our Digital Lives Are Altering the World Around Us, will join Jeremy Clark , assistant professor in the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering , to explore what privacy means in a context where self-tracking and sharing are routine.\nHow does all this self-tracking relate to how connected we feel? How safe are we when so much of our personal information is online?\nMarch 14: Connect the Dots — The Science of Crime\nKathy Reichs , a forensic anthropologist and best-selling novelist, and Concordia’s Cameron Skinner , an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , will address the complex stories emerging from science and how they help us connect the dots.\nThe Concordia and The Globe and Mail Conversations are free of charge and open to the public.

{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/students/undergraduate/appointments-academic-advisors.html", "field": "artsci_psychology", "title": "Appointments with Academic Advisors", "text": "Honours\nAm I on track to graduate?\nIn order to graduate, you are required to complete a specific number of Psychology credits and outside electives. Outside electives are courses offered in other programs outside of Psychology. You also must ensure you have completed any missing profile courses. To check your progress in our program, and track to make sure you are going to be able to graduate, use the program check sheets here: https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/students/undergraduate/monitoring-academic-progress.html\nIf you are still uncertain after having completed the program check sheet, you can make an appointment to see an academic advisor. Always bring the completed checklist with you when seeing an academic advisor\nWhen will I finish my degree?\nThis depends on your degree, the number of credits you need to graduate (90, 108, 120), the number of credits taken per semester, and if you also take summer courses. For example, if you are a full-time student taking 12 credits per semester, you can complete 90 credits in 4 years. If you take 15 credits per semester, it will take you three years to complete 90 credits.\nHow many credits do I need to do per semester?\nTo be a full-time student in Quebec, you must take a minimum of 12 credits per semester (usually 4 courses). The maximum load is 15 credits per semester (usually 5 courses). If you are worried about the workload that university courses require, we recommend you start out with 12 credits (i.e., 4 courses) in the first semester. If you can handle the workload, then go to 15 credits in subsequent semesters. If you are thinking of applying to Medicine, Law, or Graduate Degrees, then please check with the schools you plan to apply to for the degree requirements (some schools expect you to take a 15-credit to demonstrate that you can handle the workload).\nShould I take 4-5 Psychology Courses per semester?\nPsychology courses tend to demand more work from the student than other general elective courses. This is especially the case for courses that have a laboratory component (i.e., PSYC310, PSYC315, PSYC311, PSYC316). While it is possible to take a full Psychology course load per semester, it is not recommended. Instead, taking 2-3 psychology courses, in addition to 1-2 general electives is recommended.\nFor the summer semester, how many courses should I take?\nGiven the shorter more compact nature of the summer courses, we recommend taking no more than 6 credits (i.e., two courses) per summer term. Students wishing to receive financial aid during the summer are required to undertake 12 credits during the two summer terms.\nShould I drop a course?\nStudents will sometimes think they should stay in a course even though they are doing poorly, as they have heard that a DISC looks bad on their transcript. It is ok to have a DISC on your transcript – this happens from time to time as students like the initial idea of a course, but find it different when taking it.  Also, as DISC is better than receiving an F for a course, as a poor grade affects your GPA (a DISC does not count towards your GPA). However, try to not make a habit of having too many DISCs.\nDo I need to meet with an advisor to repeat a course?\nStudents can repeat a course at any point, without making an advising appointment. The exception is if you are trying to repeat a course which is a prerequisite for another course you are or have taken.\nStudents should think of the following before repeating a course:\n1)     While re-taking a course can improve your GPA this will only happen if you do better than you did the first time. If you end up with a lower grade in the re-take, then this will lower your GPA. The last taken grade is what counts towards the GPA.\n2)     The earlier grade will remain on your transcript, and will not disappear.\n3)     How have things changes since the first time you took the course? Have you improved your work load or study habits to give yourself a better opportunity for improving your grade?\nHow many courses / what grades do I need to raise my GPA?\nThis is a common question from students that are either attempting to graduate, are thinking of applying to graduate school, or are in academic jeopardy (e.g., conditional standing, failed standing) the best way to answer this question is to try out different course and grade scenarios to see how these may impact your GPA. We have made available a simple excel spreadsheet for this purpose (download link here).\n \nQUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO SPECIALIZATION STUDENTS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE OPTIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE COURSE (PSYC 485)\nWhen do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses?\nYou must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 485. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 485. Keep in mind that PSYC 485 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload.\nWhen do I take PSYC 485?\nPSYC 485 is an optional course for students in the specialization program who wish to have the opportunity to conduct research. You would apply to take this course in the summer before your final year after you have received your grades from the winter term. You must have a minumim GPA of 3.0, and a thesis supervisor to be admitted. A completed application form and a 'supervisor-student-contract' (both available on the department website in the FORMS section) must be submitted with your application.\nHow do I find a thesis supervisor?\nIt is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them. Be aware that there are a limited number of spots so register early!\nQUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO HONOURS.\nWhen do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses?\nYou must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 495. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 495. Keep in mind that PSYC 495 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload.\nWhen do I take PSYC 490, 491, and 495?\nThe Honours Seminars (PSYC 490, 491) and Honours Thesis Seminar (PSYC495) are taken in the final year of the honours program. To be able to register for these classes, you must have completed PSYC 311 and get permission from the department, which will be given once you have a confirmed thesis supervisor. You would take these courses in your final year provided your grades warrant your completing the honours program (have and maintain a minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA in PSYC courses, and 3.3 in all others).\nHow do I find a thesis supervisor?\nIt is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them. \nHow do I secure a place in PSYC 491, 492, and 495?\nThe honours advisor will open a place for you in a particular section after you let the advisor know, by email, which faculty member has agreed to be your research thesis supervisor, and the thesis supervisor confirms by email that you are accepted into the laboratory. If you are an Honours student, you do not have to complete the 'supervisor-student-contract' at this point (available on the department website in the FORMS section), as you will do so during the first week of the thesis class.\nWho can register me?\nYou register yourself once a place has been opened for you. You will receive an email, after registration begins, listing the specific sections to which you have been admitted.\nCan I pick a thesis / seminar section?\nNo. Students are assigned to a thesis / seminar section by the honours advisor. This procedure provides an even distribution of the number of thesis students and research topics across all sections.\nWhat if I don’t yet have confirmation of a place in the honours courses when my date for registration occurs?\nAll the seminar and thesis courses occur at the same time (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 16:15 pm to 18:45). With that schedule in mind, you can register for all your other courses when your date for registration occurs.\n \nFor career counselling, you should visit the Career and Placement Services Department .\nAcademic advisors provide advice about your academic program:\nwhich program you should be in;\nwhether your progress is satisfactory;\nwhat to do if you run into problems in your courses; and\nanswer questions about graduate school and academic opportunities following graduation.\nAdvising in the Department of Psychology is reserved exclusively for students currently enrolled in a Psychology program.\n \n"}

{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/programs/graduate/faq.html", "field": "artsci_psychology", "title": "Graduate Admission FAQ", "text": "Prerequisite Courses for the MA Program in Psychology (Research & Clinical Training Option)\nI want to be a Psychologist!\n....but I don’t think I meet the requirements of having “an Honours Undergraduate degree in Psychology (BA or BSc) with a high GPA” that is required for application to the graduate program in Psychology. What are my options?\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about admission to our graduate program in Clinical Psychology\nQ. I primarily want to be a Clinical Psychologist. What are the other local opportunities to develop the type of career that I want?\nA. There are many different graduate programs that allow one to have a career as a psychologist or therapist. Some local universities offer a Psy.D. in Psychology (e.g. psy.umontreal.ca/programmes-­et-­cours/cycles-­superieurs/doctorat‐en-­psychologie‐clinique/ ). This is a doctoral degree in Psychology that does not require the research component of a Ph.D. thesis. Other graduate programs include Counselling Psychology (e.g. www.mcgill.ca/edu‐ecp/), and Art, Drama or Music Therapy (e.g. creativeartstherapies.concordia.ca/ ). Different programs may or may not have the strict research pre-­requisites and heavy research component that are required for an M.A./Ph.D. Program in Clinical Psychology.\nQ. What are my chances of being accepted into the graduate “Research and Clinical Training Option” in Psychology at Concordia?\nA. Although we receive hundreds of applications from highly qualified honours students, we are only able to accept 11 new clinical students each year. Students that do not have a conventional honours undergraduate degree in psychology or its equivalent, or who have not completed an empirical research thesis as part of their undergraduate studies, can sometimes be at a further disadvantage.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist, but I don’t have an undergraduate degree in Psychology. What are my options?\nA. Due to our accreditation from the CPA and APA, we require certain pre-requisite psychology course competencies prior to entrance into the graduate program. You can enrol in a university undergraduate psychology program and complete these courses ‐ as listed in our honours degree equivalency checklist. If you already have a BA or BSc degree, you do not need to complete a second degree in psychology, merely the pre-requisite courses.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but it isn’t an honours degree. What are my options?\nA. This presents a little more of a problem. If you already have an undergraduate degree in psychology, you cannot enrol in a second undergraduate psychology degree program. You can enrol as an independent student in some cases, but many universities, including Concordia, restrict the higher level psychology courses to psychology majors. Thus, you may not have access to the courses you need when enrolled as an independent student. Some universities, including McGill, offer a special status student program to make up for any course deficiencies for graduate school ( www.psych.mcgill.ca/grad/program/application_admission.htm ). At the present time, Concordia does not have a qualifying program for this purpose.\nQ. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but my grades are below what is required (minimum GPA of 3.5/4.3). What are my options?\nA. Grades aren’t the only factor taken into account when considering an applicant for graduate school. For example research experience is weighed very heavily. However, this particular program is very competitive and the odds of someone with a low GPA being accepted into the clinical program are very low. Some students feel that taking a few more courses and getting better grades will help. Usually a few courses will not have a great impact on the overall GPA and all courses are weighted equally during our admissions process.\nQ. I don’t have an Honours Psychology degree, but I have lots of work experience in counselling and/or therapy. Can my work experience be considered for my application instead of university courses or research experience?\nA. Our graduate program is heavily based upon the research-practitioner model. It is assumed that counselling/therapy skills will be taught once in the program so they are not a pre-requisite for entry into the program. Thus, pre-requisite coursework and research experience are considered most important for our admissions process and prior counselling experience cannot replace those.\nQ. If I apply to the graduate Psychology Program (Research Option) and I am accepted to that program, can I later switch to the Research and Clinical Option?\nA. No. If a student is accepted into the graduate program, “Research Option” they are not eligible to later apply to the “Research and Clinical Training Option”.\nChecklist 1\nPrerequisite Courses for the MA Program in Psychology, (Research Training Option)\nAn honours undergraduate degree in Psychology, or its equivalent, is required for the Research Training Option.

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

But for most university students, the coming weeks mean final exams , mounting stress and negative moods .\nWhile that doesn’t seem like an ideal combination for great grades, new Concordia research shows that the occasional bout of bad feelings can actually improve students’ academic success.\nA study published in Developmental Psychology by Erin Barker , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science , shows that students who were mostly happy during their four years of university but who also experienced occasional negative moods had the highest GPAs at the time of graduation.\nIn contrast, the study also confirmed that students who experienced high levels of negative moods and low levels of positive moods often ended up with the lowest GPAs — a pattern consistent with depressive disorders.\n“Students often report feeling overwhelmed and experiencing high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms,” says Barker, who is also a member of the Centre for Research in Human Development .\n“This study shows that we need to teach them strategies to both manage negative emotions and stress in productive ways, and to maintain positive emotional experiences.”\nFor the study, Barker and her co-authors* worked with 187 first-year students at a large university. The researchers tracked the students throughout their four years of schooling by having them complete questionnaires about recent emotional experiences each year, beginning in the first year and continuing throughout their undergraduate degree.\n \nNegative emotions signal a challenge\n“We looked at students’ response patterns to better understand how experiences of positive and negative emotions occurred over time. We then combined average patterns to look how each person varied from their own average and examined different combinations of trait and state affects together,” Barker explains.\n“This allowed us to identify the pattern associated with the greatest academic success: those who were happy for the most part, but who also showed bouts of elevated negative moods.”\nThese findings demonstrate that both negative and positive emotions play a role in our successes.\n“We often think that feeling bad is bad for us. But if you're generally a happy person, negative emotions can be motivating. They can signal to you that there is a challenge that you need to face. Happy people usually have coping resources and support that they draw on to meet that challenge.”\nIn January, Barker and psychology graduate students Sarah Newcomb-Anjo and Kate Mulvihill will expand on this research by launching a new study focused on life beyond graduation. Their plan: examine patterns of emotional experience and well-being as former students navigate new challenges associated with finding work or entering a post-graduation program.\n*Partners in research: This study was co-authored by Carsten Wrosch , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, Andrea L. Howard from Carleton University and Nancy L. Galambos from the University of Alberta. The research was funded by a grant awarded to N. Galambos by the the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. \nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

You may select either the Major, Honours or Specialization . You can opt for the Bachelor of Arts (BA) or the Bachelor of Science (BSc) , which requires electives in the science.\nAre you a student registered in another department? You can add a minor in Psychology to complement your degree.\nWhat's more, Psychology BSc students may complete a Specialization or Honours in  Behavioural Neuroscience . \nBA or BSc?\nWhat is the difference between a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Science (BSc)?\nMost students will have to complete 90 credits to earn a Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Most courses are worth three or six credits. Therefore, to complete a Bachelor's degree one would have to complete the equivalent of 30, three credit courses. If you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream.\nIn terms of your Psychology courses, there is no difference between the BA degree and the BSc. The difference comes in the electives. Science students will select a number of their electives from the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics) while Arts student will select primarily from the arts and humanities.\nA science background is required for students contemplating careers in neuroscience and it may be an asset in applying for medical school.\nMajor, Specialization, or Honours\nWhat is the difference between Major, Specialization, and Honours?\nIf you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream. The minor is available to students majoring in a subject other than Psychology.\nThe Major consists of 42 credits in Psychology and is relevant for someone seeking a good general degree which could have applications in a variety of fields related to teaching, business, personnel, or community involvement.\nThe Specialization consists of 60 credits in Psychology and as a more concentrated program is appropriate for someone with career plans in an area involving Psychology. It can prepare students for employment in such areas as those listed above for the Major but is recognized as a more intensive degree. Depending on the selection of courses the Specialization may also provide a background for graduate work such as a Master’s degree in counselling Psychology, or social work, or even in an MBA program.\nThe Honours degree is the most intensive of all consisting of 66 credits of Psychology and including two Honours seminars and an Honours thesis in the last year. At least partly because of these courses this program gives the best preparation for admission to graduate school. Admission to Honours is by application and normally occurs after a student’s first 30 credits have been completed with a GPA of 3.5. Students may apply to the Honours program directly from CEGEP if they have a CRC of at least 28.\n"}

I want to know what people are up to,” says Nisi Sinzinkayo, a Moncton, N.B., transplant. For her, Concordia’s Department of Psychology was a natural fit. As Sinzinkayo says: “I see this as a way to understand people even more.”\nDepartment of Psychology student Nisi Sinzinkayo\nBefore taking the plunge and moving to Montreal for her undergraduate studies, Sinzinkayo had developed a strong opinion of both Concordia and Montreal.\n“I visited the city and have friends who attended Concordia,” says Sinzinkayo. “I like how open-minded people are here. People don’t judge you.”\nOne hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.\n“Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,” says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit.\nSinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.\n“That was a great email to receive,” says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school. “I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,” she says.\nSinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions. \n“If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,” says Sinzinkayo. “I would like to complete a PhD.”\n“Psychology is a good foundational education. As a ‘plan B’ I would want to go into marketing.”\nSinzinkayo expects to finish her bachelor’s degree by 2018.\n#CUgiving\nRead more inspiring stories like this one in Momentum, Concordia's Donor and Student Awards newsletter.\nRelated links\n"}

By using photographs and video of natural scenes, my aim is to isolate what properties of an image do we use to recognize and classify the type of scene we are viewing, and how do changes in these properties alter our perception of the image. This research employed traditional techniques such as psychophysics and eye tracking, as well as new techniques such as computational neuroscience, gaze-contingent stimuli modifications, augmented virtual reality, as well as studying the underlying neural activity using EEG. My research  also focuses on how various visual (e.g., macular degeneration), cognitive  (e.g., stress, dual-tasking), and the loss of other senses (e.g., hearing loss) effect the visual system, and in particular, eye movements.

First, the hippocampus and other nearby cortical areas are thought to integrate sensory inputs into a cohesive representation. Then, memory is stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. A major mechanism through which circuits of the brain can learn is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My lab examines how changes in synaptic strength occur in parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat. Electrophysiological recording techniques are used to monitor synaptic strength and to examine how neuromodulatory systems (cholingergic, dopaminergic) and rhythmic EEG activities control changes in how neurons interact with one another.\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students make important contributions to this research.

I am interested in studying situations in which multiple tasks are either carried out in sequential order, or are performed concurrently. A portion of my current work investigates the coordination of cognitive and motor tasks in old age (e.g., walking, balance, finger sequencing, with a concurrent cognitive load). An important theme in my research is to understand the adaptive strategies that older adults develop in response to declines in cognitive and sensorimotor abilities.

Recent work has explored differences between Chinese and Euro-Canadians in the presentation of depression, using cross-national and acculturation designs in student, community, and clinical samples. Once cultural differences are identified, the emphasis is on why these differences occurred; the potential role of the self-concept is central to these efforts. I also have a secondary interest in the borderline between normality, abnormal personality, and psychopathology, focusing on conceptual problems with Depressive Personality Disorder.\nSelected publications\nRyder, A.

Specifically, I am interested in disorders of childhood, and in the environmental and social contexts in which children's development takes place. My clinical supervision focuses on the assessment and treatment of children referred for learning, emotional, social and behavioral problems. The focus is on the child, the family, and the environment (including daycare, school, and home settings). Assessment and treatment typically focus on the development of age-appropriate social and cognitive skills, as well as on emotional, behavioral and family problems, with treatment modality determined by the needs of the case. In recent years children have been seen under my supervision for problems including learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, behavior and attentional disorders, conduct disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Students under my direction have learned to use cognitive-behavioral therapy, play therapy, crisis management, and family therapy approaches, and to integrate these diverse theoretical models in developing effective strategies for intervention.\nDALE STACK,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests\nMy clinical experience is in the area of assessment and treatment of difficulties that occur in children (and their families).    My particular focus is working with very young children (preschoolers) and their families.   This area encompasses a range of problems including (but not limited to) developmental delays, expressive and/or receptive language delays, pervasive developmental disorders, behavior problems, sensory and physical disabilities, adjustment difficulties, child management and parenting, and family issues.   My general approach is cognitive-behavioral.   I underscore the importance of comprehensive assessment and I utilize alternative assessment procedures when valuable (e.g., non-verbal, non-compliant, etc.,).   Given the age range of the children, my clinical work involves direct contact with the child and his/her parent(s)/caregivers (and family).\n \nClinical Supervisors (External)\nSome of the clinicians who have recently supervised clinical students from Concordia (as a primary or case supervisor) on a clinical practicum or internship in  external settings  are:\nPerry Adler, Mélanie Archambault, Susan Barza, Jeanne Beaudry, Karina Béland, Claude Bélanger, Nathalie Belda, Sophie Bergeron, Johan Binette, Irv Binik, Caminee Blake, Hildegard Brack, William Brender, Sophie Brière, Thomas Brown, Ken Bruce, Christiane Chalfoun, Tinaz Chinoy, Rebecca Cohen, Lois Colle, Mike Coward, Fern Cramer-Azima, Sylvie Daigneault, David D’Alessandro, Elaine De Guise, Paule Delisle, Mary DeRemer, Nathalie Desormeaux, Louise Dessertine, Nathalie Dinh, Marc Simon Drouin, Lucie Fortin, Hallie Frank, Danny Gagnon, Ann Gamsa, Carole Gendron, Marc-André Généreux, Constantina Giannopoulos, Sylvie Goulet, Judy Gradinger, Rachel Green, Linda Greenberg, Pierre Grégoire, Corinne Gutman, Esther Handelman, Karen Hardoon, Geneviève Janveau-Brennan, Martin Jodoin-St-Onge, Jasmine Joncas, Marilyn Jonesgotman, Dennis Kalogeropoulos, Felicia Kaufman, Leslie Klein, Nathan Kuperstok, Constance Lalinec-Michaud, Henry Lavigueur, François Lefebvre, Judith Le Gallais, Gabriel Leonard, Stephanie Leonard, Nathalie Liboiron, Robert Loveless, Solange Marchildon, Suzanne Marcotte, Stephanie Margolese, Chantale Martel, Valentin Mbekou, Muriel Michel, Daniel Moisan, Linda Moxley-Haegert, Carolyn Nelham, Sylvain Néron, Margaret O’Byrne, Zbigniew Pleszewski, Nancy Poirier, Cecile Quirouette, Sandra Rafman, Maria Ramsay, Christina Saltaris, Liliane Sayegh, Miriam Scherer Berkovic, Alessandra Schiavetto, Connie Scuccimarri, Monique Séguin, Esther Sidoli-Leblanc, Maxine Sigman, Thérèse Simard, David Sinyor, Liliane Spector, Dale Stack, Julie St-Amand, Chantal Ste-Marie, Guylaine St-Pierre, Maria Sufrategui, Angeles Toharia, Mary Tsonis, Julie Vachon, Monica Chantal Vasquez, Deborah Weissberg Morrison, Ruta Westreich, Anne Wittevrongel, Sepi Zargarpour, Phyllis Zelkowitz.\nProfiles of Clinical Faculty\nLUCIE BONNEVILLE\nMy clinical interests are in several areas such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety and psychotic symptoms.  My orientation is eclectic.  In general, I use techniques from the models of Humanistic, Psychodynamic, Existential and Cognitive therapies in short and long term psychotherapy with adults and late adolescence.\nSAM BURSTEIN, Clinical Psychologist at the Montreal Children’s Hospital and in private practice. \nMy clinical experience lies mainly in the area of working with children and their families, wherein the presenting concern is child-related.

By participating in research, these students have the opportunity to gain a better appreciation of psychological testing and experimentation. However, as there are potential risks associated with classroom recruitment and student testing, these guidelines are intended to facilitate the collection of participants and/or data in undergraduate classroom settings at Concordia University, while protecting the rights of student research participants.\nApproaching the Instructor\nThe instructor should be provided with the following information well in advance of the classroom visit:\nWho is supervising the project.\nWhen the recruiter would prefer to visit the class.\nHow long the class visit will take.\nThe nature of the recruitment (sign up sheet, screening questionnaire, etc.)\nWhat (if any) testing will occur at the time of recruitment.\nRecruiting in Class\nWhen the recruiter visits the classroom, the following information should be provided to the students:\nThe name of the recruiter(s) and the faculty member(s) supervising the project.\nContact information for the lab(s) in which the study is being conducted.\nWhat the study is meant to investigate.\nThe nature of the study (questionnaire based, interview based, brief description of experimental tasks, etc.).\nThe amount of time required to participate in the study.\nWhat compensation (if any) participants will receive for their time.\nWhen the study is being conducted (Are appointments set?, Can students drop by the lab?, etc.).\nStudent should be informed that the data that they may provide during the course of their participation are completely unrelated to their required coursework or grade.\nThat participation is completely voluntary and that participants can refuse or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences whatsoever.\nThe nature and/or limits of confidentiality in the study. Ideally, the recruiter should leave the room while sign up sheets and/or questionnaires are being completed so that students will be free to either participate or decline to participate.\nTesting in Class\nDue to the possible demands produced by testing in groups, in the presence of experimenters and/or in the presence of course instructors, testing in classrooms is discouraged.\nIf in-class testing is deemed to be essential, the following measures (in addition to the above 10 points) should be taken to protect students from coercion and to ensure the confidentiality of their participation:\nParticipants should be told that their results will not be made available to their instructor.\nParticipants who choose not to participate should not be separated or otherwise identified during classroom testing. (This may be accomplished by distributing packages to all students in the class and then stating that students are free to either spoil the materials or leave them blank before returning them.)\nIn addition to written debriefing (see below), students should receive a brief oral debriefing in class about the purpose of the study.\nDebriefing\nAll experimental and study participants have the right to be debriefed from psychological studies. In order to facilitate both a greater understanding of research in psychology and to provide other sources of related information about the study, student participants should receive a brief written debriefing sheet (less than one half page) upon completion of the study.\nThe debriefing sheet should contain the following information:\nThe name of the study, the experimenter(s) and the faculty supervisor(s).\nThe telephone and other contact information for the lab(s) in which the study was conducted as well as contact information for the University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Psychology Department Ethics Committee.\n*The nature of the study (hypotheses, goals, etc.).\n*Some information about the design of the study (groups, measures, etc.).\nA brief statement about the importance or implications of the study.\nCitation of one or two suggested articles or book chapters for further reading.\n*If the study involves deception, it is acceptable for items 3 and 4 to be somewhat vague when distributed in written form, provided that a full oral debriefing is given to each participant. Ideally, this sheet will be accompanied by a brief oral debriefing period in which the above are explained to the student participant.\nDebriefing\nAll experimental and study participants have the right to be debriefed from psychological studies.

The master's degree requires a minimum of one year of full-time study and involves - in addition to the thesis - course work in psychological theory and advanced statistics, seminars in the student's area of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes), and directed teaching in our undergraduate program. The doctoral program involves similar advanced training: independent research; supervised reading, research and course work in subject matter and methods in the area of research specialization; program-wide research and methods seminars; and teaching experience. Doctoral studies require a minimum of two years of full-time study.\nResearch\nStudents are provided the resources to conduct research throughout their graduate education. All new students are accepted into our program by a faculty member who is willing to provide supervision and financial support. Thus, each student is associated with a research team comprised of faculty and graduate students. Research teams within the department are organized around four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes) and pursue a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) appetitive motivation and drug dependence, problems in human development, cognitive and perceptual processes, and anxiety disorders.\nBecause entering students have often had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, students who complete the Ph.D. degree achieve a high level of research specialization and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, most students have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences. There are several sources of funding within the Department for student travel to scientific conferences. Also, students are expected to publish articles on their research in scientific journals.\nExamples of recent student publications\nTrewartha, K. M., Endo, A., Li, K. Z. H., & Penhune, V. B. (2009).

Thus, students have ample opportunity to interact with their supervisor and other faculty and students of their research teams.\n"}
{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/programs/graduate/research-clinical-training.html", "field": "artsci_psychology", "title": "Research & clinical training option", "text": "GooglePlus\nResearch & clinical training option\nThe research and clinical training option is based on the scientist-practitioner model.That is, clinical students fulfill the same research requirements as other students, but they also receive professional training in the delivery of psychological services. The program's goal is to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists who not only conduct research and contribute to the scientific base of the discipline but who are also competent mental health professionals. Because research is such an important part of our program, students seeking only professional training or who do not intend to continue to the PhD degree should apply elsewhere.\nOverview\nStudents with BA or BSc degrees begin their studies in the first year of the research and clinical training option, which includes course work in psychological theory and research design, clinical theory and practice, and a master's thesis. Students enroll in the MA in Psychology and the Diploma in Clinical Psychology. The MA portion of the research and clinical training option requires a minimum of one year of full time study, the Diploma an additional 8 months.\nFollowing successful completion of the master's thesis and courses, students continue doctoral studies, in which they receive advanced training in research methods, psychological theory, and clinical practice. Besides continuous involvement in research in one of the department's four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, and Human Development and Developmental Processes) during their training, students also conduct a doctoral thesis, which must be a substantive piece of original research. The doctoral program requires a minimum of two years of full-time study. Following their doctoral thesis research, students complete a one-year, full-time internship in a clinic or hospital setting. \nOur clinical psychology program has been accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association since 1986 and by the Ordre des psychologues du Québec since 2004.\nThe Canadian Psychological Association requires disclosure of information on the applicant pool, acceptance rates, diversity, graduates, and other details about our programme. This information can be found here .\nFor more details on the policies and procedures of the clinical program please refer to the policies and procedures manual .\n \nAccreditation Panel of the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA)\n141 Laurier Ave. West, Suite 702\nOttawa, Ontario K1P 5J3\nOrdre des Psychologues du Québec (OPQ)\n1100 Beaumont avenue, suite 510\nMont-Royal, Québec H3P 3H5\nPhilosophy & mission\nOur program adheres to the Boulder scientist-practitioner model of training. This means that we strongly endorse the principle that a scientist-practitioner has a research orientation to his/her practice, and we encourage clinical relevance in research. Our model encompasses learning and career pathways individually tailored to student interest and faculty expertise. This permits a wide range of research emphases including those of basic research, while at the same time placing the highest value on the close integration of science and practice. The principal objective of our program is to produce graduates who have the necessary skills to function as researchers and as practitioners, who may function as either or both, and who meet the highest standards in the science and practice of psychology.\nProgram goals & outcomes\nOur program adheres to the Accreditation Criteria and Principles of the Canadian and American Psychological Associations and the Ordre des psychologues du Québec in its specific goals for clinical training. The principal objective is that a graduate of our program be\ncapable of functioning as an investigator and as a practitioner, and may function as either or both, consistent with the highest standards in psychology (Belar & Perry, 1992, p. 72).\nOur specific objectives include that our graduates:\nBe capable of conducting and publishing high quality psychological research in domains that have the potential to enhance the practice of psychology.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the theoretical and empirical roots in psychology of both clinical research and practice, and of current relevant developments in other areas of specialization in psychology.\nDemonstrate specialized knowledge of the major theoretical, methodological, and empirical work in clinical psychology, with both adults and children.\nBe capable of implementing theory-based, research-supported clinical practice, including assessment and treatment, with both adults and children.\nDemonstrate ethical and professional awareness and conduct in both their practice and their research.\nBe competent in dealing with individual and cultural diversity in values, beliefs and customs.\nBe capable of communicating knowledge to others.\nBe capable of consulting effectively with other professions, clients, and organizations.\nBe familiar with models of supervision, and competent in the supervision of other professionals.\nFunctions for which students are prepared\nStudents in our program receive the necessary academic, scientific, and clinical training so that they may contribute to psychological science and clinical practice in significant ways upon graduation.\nOur goal is to produce clinical psychologists who are highly trained in both the science of psychology and the methods of clinical practice, and who embody the roles of both researcher and clinical practitioner.\nGraduates of our program go on to careers in clinical and/or academic psychology in settings including hospitals, universities, health care clinics, and private practice.  Their activities are diverse and can include assessment, therapy, intervention, research, teaching, consultation, supervision and/or program planning in a wide variety of client populations.\n"}

My projects are aimed at identifying and measuring the fundamental characteristics of children's interactions and relationships with their peers and determining how these experiences affect behavioral development, emotional adjustment and physical health.   The four current themes of my research projects are (a) contextual/cultural variation in the peer experiences and the processes that account for variations in their effects, (b)  the intersection between peer experiences and psychophysiology especially the response to stress, (c) gene/environment interactions  and gene environment correlations and the long term consequences of peer experiences, and (d) gender differences especially as they are related to culture.\nSelected publications\nBukowski, W.

[PubMed] [Content]\nResearch\nDrug and Alcohol Abuse, Relapse, Neuropharmacology, Pavlovian conditioning, Optogenetics\nOverview: Fundamental learning processes like Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning play a central role in the use, misuse and abuse of psychoactive substances like alcohol. In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.\nFunding: My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Fonds de la recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQ-S), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Concordia University.\nCurrent graduate students: Franca Lacroix, Atyeh Heidari-Jam, Milan Valyear and Franz Villaruel\nResearch Assistants: Melanie Chahine, Sabrina Heffernan\nChaudhri lab, 2013\nBiography\nDr. Chaudhri earned her B.A. in Biological Foundations of Behavior with a concentration in Neuroscience at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA.

In this context, we examine risk and resiliency factors impacting the physiological consequences of cumulative or chronic exposure to social and environmental stressors over the life course, notably depression, rumination, and sleep. We are also interested in identifying neurophysiological indicators of sensitivity to the social environment and vulnerability to stress, with a particular emphasis on oxytocin and heart rate variability. \nCurrent funded studies examine:\n-The impact of chronic stress and interpersonal relationships on depression and systemic inflammation among parents of adolescents and adults with neurodevelopmental disorders during the transition to adulthood.

Distortions and creations of memories are particularly relevant to our understanding of day to day memory, experience and self-consciousness. This research has important implications in the legal (eye-witness testimonies, autobiographical memories, expert testimony), and clinical (causal attributions of current symptoms) contexts. We seek to better understand the factors at play when an individual attempts to remember real life events. Individual factors, like suggestibility and hypnotizability, social-psychological factors (beliefs, expectations) and cognitive factors like one’s attentional and perceptual networks are some of the factors that we believe important in understanding the construction of memories. A second area of research investigates the different aspects of hypnotizability and hypnosis. What makes an individual hypnotizable? Why do individuals respond differently to a hypnotic induction? What is the role of volition in hypnotic and non-hypnotic responses? How can hypnotic behaviours and experiences inform us on conscious and non-conscious processes? A final area of interest is the theoretical evaluation of the scientificity of psychological concepts that are commonly used in lay and professional contexts.  Examples of these are consciousness and non-consciousness, volition, intuition, repression, dissociation, body memories, etc.\nThe common thread relating these three areas is the evaluation of the role of non-conscious processes, proximal (attentional processing) and distal (beliefs), in the elicitation of overt behaviours and experiences.\nBack to top\n"}

My research program is based on the theory          that psychological stress is a risk factor only in those individuals who          are in some manner psychologically and/or biologically susceptible, and          that the etiology of cardiovascular disease is multifactorial in nature.          My approach has therefore been to examine alone and in interaction the          moderating influences of emotion, race, gender and family history on the          cardiovascular response to psychological stress. For example, we are currently          involved in two areas of research involving individual difference factors          in the risk for cardiovascular disease. One research stream involves the          study of hostile individuals who are at elevated risk for heart disease.          We are currently examining their cardiovascular responses to interpersonal          stress, and the potential role of serotonin in moderating the hostility-cardiovascular          relationship. A second stream involves the study of cardiovascular and          ambulatory blood pressure responses to laboratory and daily life stress          in Canadian Black men and women who are at elevated risk for hypertension          (high blood pressure).\nSelected publications\nMiller,            S.B., & Sita, A.

Seriously.\nResearch\nObject recognition, spatial memory, fear learning, context memory, neural systems\nOverview: My interests broadly include animal cognition, and the analysis and development of methods and procedures for assessing various types of memory in rodents. For example, some of our recent studies revealed concerns about the internal validity of a widely-used novel-object preference test of object-recognition memory. We are now developing a new and improved object-recognition task.\nWe also study spatial memory, fear learning, memory for contextual information, and the modulation of memory by contextual cues. We employ an array of behavioral paradigms to assess different aspects of memory, including water-maze, t-maze, radial-arm maze, and open-field tests of spatial memory, novel-object preference and delayed nonmatching-to-sample tests of object recognition, shock-probe fear learning, predator avoidance, and social transmission of food preferences.\nAdditional interests include the anatomy of memory systems underlying object-recognition and spatial memory. We occasionally conduct studies to assess these abilities in rats with surgical lesions of specific brain areas. Past studies have focused mainly on hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, amygdala, intralaminar and midline thalamus.\nTo develop their reputations as independent researchers, my graduate students are encouraged to pursue lines of inquiry they can call their own. The main requirements for a suitable research plan are: 1) the questions must be timely and important to behavioural neuroscientists, 2) we must have the financial and physical resources to conduct the research, and 3) we must have expertise with the required behavioural tests. Recent Ph.D. students did dissertation research on a rat model of schizophrenia, and the modulatory effects of estrogen on object-recognition memory.\nFunding\nMy research is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).\nLab members\nAn up-to-date list of lab members can be found at my lab website.\nBack to top\n"}

My research aims to explicate the positive (drinking to increase positive affect) and negative (drinking to reduce negative affect) reinforcement pathways that lead to problematic drinking, particularly for those transitioning from adolescence to early adulthood. Within this framework I examine the role of individual-level factors such as personality (i.e., motivational drive), anxiety, impulsivity, and alcohol-related cognitions (e.g., attitudes, associations, cognitive processes) to distinguish who is at risk and the processes of risk. In one line of my current work I am examining the interactive effects of behavioural inhibition/disinhibition and state affect on cue elicited alcohol associations, impulsivity, and subsequent alcohol use. Planned work in my lab includes: (a) refining measurement of alcohol-related cognition, such as assessments of implicit attitudes; (b) isolating social anxiety - and the intervening mechanisms - as a risk factor for negative reinforcement (self-medication) drinking in University students widely, and for women specifically; (c) integrating environmental-level factors (e.g., context)  into models of risk.\nGrant institution funding\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR )\nFonds de recherché sur la société et la culture Quebec ( FQRSC )\nSelected publications\nO'Connor, R.

One goal of this research program is to develop screening instruments for autism spectrum disorders. (SSHRC Insight grant).

After completing his postdoctoral training with Dr. Yavin Shaham at the National Institute on Drug Abuse/NIH in 2002, he headed the behavioral laboratory in D-Pharm Ltd., Rehovot, Israel. At the same time, he was appointed a senior lecturer at the Academic College Tel Aviv-Yaffo. In 2004 he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University. He held a Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology of Drug Abuse (Tier II; 2004-2015).\nResearch\nDrug abuse, Relapse, Animal models, Behavioural neurobiology, Eating disorders\nOverview\nUsing an animal model for drug self-administration, the research in my lab targets the brain mechanisms underlying the strikingly similar behaviors characterizing drug addiction and eating disorders. In addition, I am interested in the effects of early-life experiences on the development of mental disorders, susceptibility to drug abuse and eating disorders in the adult organism.\nDrug abuse and eating disorders are having an increasing impact on Western Society. New and more effective treatments are only likely to be developed once the interaction between the neural systems that underlie these disorders are understood.\nMy research involves two main themes that are concerned with factors that promote and maintain substance abuse. The first arises from my previous work showing that food deprivation potently induced relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking in laboratory rats, and that this effect is attenuated by leptin, a hormone involved in appetite regulation and energy balance. These data indicate a link between substance abuse and eating control mechanisms. We use a model of food-restriction-induced relapse to drugs in rats that is based on the drug self-administration procedure. We then examine the brains of the manipulated rats in search of the mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenomena.\nThe second theme is concerned with the often-reported comorbidity of drug abuse with mental disorders, and more specifically, eating disorders. We are using activity-induce anorexia as a model for anorexia nervosa to study factors that affect vulnerability to drugs and natural rewards and identify changes in underlying neuromechanisms.\nFunding\nMy research has been funded by grants from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Canada Research Chairs program (CRC) and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).\nTeaching activities\nCourses taught in recent years\nPSYC 355 - Fundamentals of Behavioural Neurobiology\nPSYC 450 - Neurobiology of Drug Abuse\nPSYC 491 - Honours Seminar\nPSYC 714 - Central Topics in Psychology\nPublications\nSedkiS, Gardner Gregory J, Luminare A, D’Cunha TM, Shalev U (2015) Food restriction-induced augmentation of heroin seeking in female rats:manipulations of ovarian hormones.

These difficulties include (but are not limited to) depression, impulsivity or eating disorders. \nEarly adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life can affect the brain in many different ways; however, the neurotransmitter serotonin is of particular interest. That is because serotonin is (i) widely implicated in a variety of psychopathologies and (ii) important for brain development, especially during infancy or childhood  (i.e., serotonin, in fact, helps to actually “build up the brain”). The overarching theme of our research program is that early adversity could disrupt the stability of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin). This in turn influences the early development of brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and could predispose the individual to psychological problems later in life, particularly when exposed to subsequent stressful events. The studies we are conducting are done in clinical and non-clinical populations and use neuro-imaging (fMRI/PET), epigenetics (DNA methylation) and/or cognitive-behavioural assessments, and is funded by various sources, including CIHR and NARSAD. \nTopics of ongoing research projects include:\n- Impact of childhood trauma on brain processes and (risk for) mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood.\n- Effect of cognitive-behavioural interventions on DNA methylation and brain function in adolescents with depression.\n- DNA methylation, childhood trauma and psychopathology (in particular mood disorders and eating disorders).\n- Impact of peer victimization on brain development and DNA methylation\n- Gene-Environment studies on brain and mental health, using twin designs.\n- Impact of early stress on oral health.\n- Impact of in utero Bisphenol-A (BPA) exposure on brain development in children\nEducation\nPhD (Leiden University, the Netherlands)\nTeaching activities\nPsychopathology: Mood, Anxiety, and Personality Disorders (Psyc 440, winter 2016 and 2017)\nPracticum Neuropsychology (2016-2017)\nPublications\nSelected recent publications\nBooij, L., Welfeld, K., Leyton, M., Dagher, A., Boileau, I., Sibon, I., Baker, G.B.,  Diksic, M., Soucy, J-P., Pruessner, J.C., Cawley – Fiset, E., Casey, K.F., Benkelfat, C.(2016). Dopamine cross-sensitization between psychostimulant drugs and stress in healthy male volunteers. Transl Psychiatry. 2016 Feb 23;6:e740. doi: 10.1038/tp.2016.6.\nChiarella, J., Tremblay, R.E., Szyf, M., Provençal, N., Booij, L.(2015). Impact of Early Environment on Children's Mental Health: Lessons From DNA Methylation Studies With Monozygotic Twins. Twin Res Hum Genet. 2015 Nov 26:1-12.

My current work focuses on three major research questions: \na) What are the neuro-computational mechanisms underlying learning in uncertain environments and how do these learning processes develop across the human lifespan? \nb) How does the ability to select and arbitrate between different learning strategies change as a function of age? \nc) How do humans learn from the behavior of other individuals and how does this ability change during lifespan development? \nTo address these questions I use a multi-methodological approach that combines experimental paradigms, computational modeling and neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI).\nSelected Publications\nNassar,M.

Frederick Westbrook.  As part of her doctoral research Mihaela visited the laboratory of Simon Killcross at Cardiff University where she embarked on research examining the role of dopamine in predicting fear.  Following completion of her PhD in 2006, Mihaela sought post-doctoral training back in the learning theory hub that is the School of Psychology at Cardiff University.  There she worked with prominent scientists including Rob Honey and Mark Good on the neurocircuitry of mnemonic integration and updating, and forged strong collaborations with John Pearce, John Aggleton, and Dominic Dwyer.  Her desire to study how the neurons change their pattern of firing as a result of environmental stimulation took her across the Atlantic to the laboratory of Geoffrey Schoenbaum. While holding appointments at University of Maryland and at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, she examined how cells in the central nucleus of the amygdala modulate their firing under conditions when fewer than expected rewards are delivered.  Mihaela was awarded a prestigious Pathways to Independence (K99/R00) award from the National Institutes of Health to conduct this work.  In 2014 Mihaela was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology where she joins the Centre for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology.\nBack to top\n"}

In the cerebellum specifically, it is not yet known how groups of cells interact to produce coordinated sensation and behavior.

I also completed a post-degree program in Elementary                                    Education at the University of Alberta   and after                                  two years of teaching I   received my professional                                  certification   as an elementary school teacher.                                  During   one year I was a counsellor in an elementary                                    school and in the second year, I taught a special                                    education class. Subsequently I attended the   University                                  of Waterloo and completed my   Ph.D. in Developmental                                  Psychology in   1986. I have been a member of the                                    Education Department, Concordia, ever since. In                                    1998 I was a visiting scholar at Lancaster University,                                    England.\nEducaton\nBA (honours) Psychology, York                                    University\nMA, Developmental Psychology                                      with a Specialization in Early Childhood Education,                                      University of Western Ontario\nPost-degree program, Elementary                                    Education, University of Alberta\nPhD, Developmental Psychology,                                    University of Waterloo\nResearch interests and current projects\nCo-construction                                      of meaning in the sibling relationship: Beginning with my dissertation, my   research                                    has been concerned with the   longitudinal nature                                    of the quality of   sibling relations, the influence                                    of   the mother on the children's relationship                                      and self_disclosure between siblings. Furthermore,                                      I am interested in how siblings co-construct                                      meaning in their relationship through play,                                      caretaking, teaching and use of   internal state                                    language (i.e.,   references to emotional, mental                                      states). Recently my work has focussed on young                                      children's social knowledge and understanding                                      of the sibling relationship, particularly within                                      the pretend play context. Currently I am   examining                                    the relations between   children pretense negotiations                                    and   conflict resolution, as well as the development                                      of intersubjectivity in sibling play and associations                                      with the quality of the relationship.   Another                                    project is investigating the   associations between                                    disclosure,   intimacy, and the quality of children                                      peer relationships in middle childhood. My current                                      SSHRC-funded project is to examine sibling teaching                                      from a social-constructivist framework.\nInfluence of the design of dramatic play                                      centers on children's play: How the ecology of the early childhood classroom,                                      specifically dramatic play centers, affects                                      children's social and cognitive play.   This project                                    has both a theoretical   and applied focus. Based                                    on theory   regarding the importance of pretend                                      play in young children's development, I have                                      conducted a series of studies to determine how                                      to facilitate opportunities for dramatic play                                      in the early childhood classroom. Several of                                      my MA students have investigated   other aspects                                    of play, such as the   relationship between solitary                                    play   and children thinking styles or the influence                                      of different kinds of play materials (e.g.,                                      superhero or scripted toys) on children.\nChild care: Specifically recent                                      child care research and implications for Canadian                                      public policy. The majority of recent research                                      on child care emanates from the United   States,                                    however the Canadian context   differs from the                                    American in   significant economic and philosophical                                      ways. My work (with E. Jacobs) has pointed to                                      the importance of considering these differences                                      for the development of child care policy.   Professor                                    Jacobs and I are currently   engaged in a pan-Canadian                                    study of   curriculum in child care settings funded                                      through Human Resources Development Canada.                                      Specifically we are looking at provincial regulations                                      and guidelines for curriculum in child care                                      settings and how curriculum is taught   to future                                    educators enrolled in   community colleges. We                                    will also   conduct an inservice intervention                                      program focused on constructivist curriculum                                      for child care workers in three provinces (Manitoba,                                      Nova Scotia, Quebec).

It deals with psychosocial risk factors in childhood which increase the likelihood of disordered behavior and maladaptive lifestyles in adulthood. Our Concordia Longitudinal Risk Research Program which began in 1976 has been following inner-city aggressive and withdrawn French-speaking children into adulthood. The aim is to determine the factors that differentiate the developmental trajectories of at-risk children who do well from those who fare badly. The children are now in their thirties; so my current interest is in how they are doing in such domains as mental and physical health, employment, competence, affiliative ties, and parenting. I have a particular interest in gender role socialization, life stresses, social support, and coping efficacy as influences on outcomes in these domains of adult functioning. Studies in the risk research program currently deal with stress; intergenerational continuities of risk factors; and childhood predictors of adult adjustment.\nEducaton\nPhD Psychology 1960; McGill University\nSelected publications\nMartin-Storey, A., Ruttle, P.

But for most university students, the coming weeks mean final exams , mounting stress and negative moods .\nWhile that doesn’t seem like an ideal combination for great grades, new Concordia research shows that the occasional bout of bad feelings can actually improve students’ academic success.\nA study published in Developmental Psychology by Erin Barker , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science , shows that students who were mostly happy during their four years of university but who also experienced occasional negative moods had the highest GPAs at the time of graduation.\nIn contrast, the study also confirmed that students who experienced high levels of negative moods and low levels of positive moods often ended up with the lowest GPAs — a pattern consistent with depressive disorders.\n“Students often report feeling overwhelmed and experiencing high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms,” says Barker, who is also a member of the Centre for Research in Human Development .\n“This study shows that we need to teach them strategies to both manage negative emotions and stress in productive ways, and to maintain positive emotional experiences.”\nFor the study, Barker and her co-authors* worked with 187 first-year students at a large university. The researchers tracked the students throughout their four years of schooling by having them complete questionnaires about recent emotional experiences each year, beginning in the first year and continuing throughout their undergraduate degree.\n \nNegative emotions signal a challenge\n“We looked at students’ response patterns to better understand how experiences of positive and negative emotions occurred over time. We then combined average patterns to look how each person varied from their own average and examined different combinations of trait and state affects together,” Barker explains.\n“This allowed us to identify the pattern associated with the greatest academic success: those who were happy for the most part, but who also showed bouts of elevated negative moods.”\nThese findings demonstrate that both negative and positive emotions play a role in our successes.\n“We often think that feeling bad is bad for us. But if you're generally a happy person, negative emotions can be motivating. They can signal to you that there is a challenge that you need to face. Happy people usually have coping resources and support that they draw on to meet that challenge.”\nIn January, Barker and psychology graduate students Sarah Newcomb-Anjo and Kate Mulvihill will expand on this research by launching a new study focused on life beyond graduation. Their plan: examine patterns of emotional experience and well-being as former students navigate new challenges associated with finding work or entering a post-graduation program.\n*Partners in research: This study was co-authored by Carsten Wrosch , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, Andrea L. Howard from Carleton University and Nancy L. Galambos from the University of Alberta. The research was funded by a grant awarded to N.

It's sponsored in part by Clinical Projects Grant from the Ordre régional des infirmières et infirmiers de Montréal/Laval, as well the CSU Special Projects fund. The CSU, Queer Concordia , Health Services and the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association (CUPA) are collaborating to run the testing events.\nTo choose from a variety of free condoms at the give-away, simply go to the Atrium of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) on the Sir George Williams Campus. You can always get free condoms at the weekly Healthy YOU at CU information table, or come by Health Services Condom Boutique where you can choose from a variety of condoms, \"3-for-$1\"!\n“The goal is to remind students that regular STI testing is a normal part of taking care of your health, just like going to the dentist,” says Gabriella Szabo, health promotion specialist with  Health Services . “And students get their results in 20 minutes, rather than 10 days.”\nBe informed and empowered\nDecember 1 is World Aids Day and a perfect occasion to have a clear-headed conversation about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). CATIE , a Canadian online source for information and resources about HIV and AIDS, is a good place to learn more about the history and contemporary reality of the disease.\nThe Concordia University Community Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS has its fourth event on December 1 from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Museum of Fine Arts. London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium.\nConsent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events.\nAt the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained: “We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,” she says.\n“Outreach activities like this are also great opportunities to start important conversations and provide information about consent, bystander intervention and preventing sexual violence.”\n \nLearn more about safe sex by reading Health Service’s 16 Safer Sex Practices .\n \n"}

At what age can children explain people’s behaviours as being guided by their mental states? Who do toddlers trust to teach them new things — and why?\nThese questions, and others like it, have been the focus of Diane Poulin-Dubois ’s research for the last 31 years at Concordia. The psychology professor from the Faculty of Arts and Science leads the Cognitive and Language Development Lab .\nOn October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award — the Prix Acfas Thérèse Gouin-Décarie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.\n“Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois’s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.\n“We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois’s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l’ACFAS (faculty award). She was also on the organizing committee when Concordia hosted the 2014 Acfas conference , “Research: Zones of Creativity and Convergence, ” welcoming 5,100 scholars and offering 173 colloquia.\nPrevious Acfas winners from the Concordia community include Michel Laroche , John Molson School of Business marketing professor, André Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, Sherry Simon , French professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science, Marguerite Mendell , professor and graduate program director for the School of Community and Public Affairs, and François-Marc Gagnon , founding director of the Gail and Stephen A. Jarislowsky Institute for Studies in Canadian Art.\nA mentor feels ‘resurrected’\n“Winning this award has a special sentimental value for me because it was recently renamed after my mentor, Thérèse Gouin-Décarie,” says Poulin-Dubois. “She is now retired but we talk frequently. She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.”\nThis career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.\n“We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.” Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example, “dog/chien”) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation.\nHer other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called “trust,” which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.\n“We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,” says Poulin-Dubois.\n“My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to? Then you can speculate how our species has evolved differently or similarly to others.”\nPraise from the department\nWilliam Bukowski , psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Centre for Research in Human Development , is thrilled that Acfas is recognizing Poulin-Dubois.\n“Diane has been at the forefront of understanding how the concepts that were popular in a Piagetian perspective can now be applied to other domains of functioning, such as bilingualism,” he says. \n“She is remarkable in her capacity to develop rigorous and very creative laboratory tests.”\nBukowski also points to Poulin-Dubois’s success as a supervisor.\nTwo of her graduate students, Cristina Crivello and Sabrina Chiarella, have won Graduate Research Communicator of the Year Awards for their papers on the benefits of bilingualism and early trust. “When your students win awards, it reflects well on everyone.

The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world.\nToday, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career.\nI grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education.\nWhen applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be “a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.”\nI had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade.\nThis allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students’ results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents.\nI have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died.\nMy hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.  \nOn Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution.\nThe government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years.\nI have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture “of the moment.” We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face.\nThe main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum — I am referring to those who did not participate.\nBut in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.\n \nFind out more about Concordia's Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it’s good for mind and body.\nIn fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood — but in markedly different ways.\nThe researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.\n“We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,” says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study’s lead author.\nIn particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain’s two hemispheres — in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.\n“This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,” Giacosa explains. “Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.”\n‘This work has major potential’\nInterestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field.\nAccording to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other. “Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.”\nVirginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study’s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.\n“This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,” Penhune says. “Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.”\nSome studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.\n“Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson’s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,” says Penhune.\n*Partners in research: The co-authors of this study — Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J. Karpati, Nicholas E.V. Foster, Virginia Penhune, and principal investigator Krista L. Hyde — are all members of the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research.

In 2015–16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity .\nThe series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.\n“Last year really exceeded our expectations,” says André Roy , dean of FAS. “So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.”\nOn Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season, “ Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,” invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations.\nHeld in collaboration with Concordia’s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes .\nAccording to Roy, this year’s series won’t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A. “We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.”\nClaudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public.\nGauthier’s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age. “I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,” she explains.\n‘Thinking outside the box’\nFellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.\n“I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,” says Chapman. “I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.”\nAnother first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the “Come to your senses” event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .\n“I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,” explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .\n“I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.”\nRoy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.\n“We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats. As great as last year was, I am confident this one will be even better.”\nThe other speakers at this fall’s first Beyond Disciplines event are:\n"}

He has accepted a professorship in Université de Montréal’s Faculty of Medicine, where he will be conducting research on exercise and brain health at the Montréal Heart Institute.\nBherer will continue his association with Concordia as associate scientific director.\nHabib Benali | Photo by David Ward\nStepping in as interim scientific director of the preventive health centre is  Habib Benali , a professor of electrical and computer engineering and PERFORM's associate scientific director of biomedical engineering.\nGraham Carr, Vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies, says Bherer has made truly exceptional contributions to Concordia.\n“He has really put his imprint on PERFORM as a centre for innovation and collaboration in the field of prevention and healthy lifestyle, which is one the most dynamic areas of health research and training.  The new opportunity he is pursuing speaks to the world-class quality of his personal research program — and to the respect that Concordia is earning as an important and unique contributor to the field of medical research in Montreal,\n“As the inaugural PERFORM chair and scientific director, Louis’s vision, energy, appetite for collaboration and ambition for success have put the centre on the map. His tireless work has enabled us to recruit outstanding faculty of international quality, attract top-quality students and postdocs and emerge as an important new partner in the Quebec and Canadian landscape of health research.\n“I am proud of and grateful for everything that Louis has given to Concordia. He is a true leader. I know I am not alone in being sad at his decision to move over the mountain, but I am very eager to pursue new collaborations as he embarks on the next phase of his astonishing career.”\nFor his part, Bherer is proud of what the PERFORM research team has been able to accomplish over the last four years. “We’ve laid the foundation for our mission of advancing research, education and community engagement while offering unique opportunities for new discoveries in preventive health research,” he says.\n“With the support and guidance of the exceptional team of researchers, students and staff we have established, PERFORM will continue to blossom in the years to come.”\nLooking forward, Carr is extremely pleased that PERFORM will be in safe hands under the leadership of Habib Benali, given the scope of his international research and administrative portfolio, his extraordinary connections with the health research community in Montréal and his commitment to the institutional vision for PERFORM.\n“We are unbelievably fortunate that a person of Habib’s calibre and experience is poised to accept the interim scientific director position,” says Carr. “As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM’s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.”\nBenali’s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position.\nPrior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Université de Montréal.\nBenali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM — part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University — until 2015.\nHe looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,” he says. “I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.”\nCarr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia’s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.\n \n"}

People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,” says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.*\nEvery second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year — the denouement, if you will.\nEthnodramas and 100 original songs\n“The theme of our show is 'We Can',” says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director. “The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.”\nPart of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist.\nThe CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas — plays based on the performers' lived experiences — as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.\n \nStephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience. “Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.”\nGoulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. “They always want me to come back, and I never say no.”\n‘Taking everyone for who they are’\nChoreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga .\nSanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.\n“It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,” she says. “They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.”\nFrom the stage to the big screen\nThe Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .\n“When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,” says Snow.\nBecause the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale.\nCrafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase.\nGet your tickets today for the Centre for the Arts in Human Development retrospective show, A Night at the Oscar , taking place June 17 and 18 at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall.\n*The Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health recognizes individuals or organizations for building awareness of mental health issues in the community through research, service, advocacy, combatting stigma or calling the public’s attention to the needs of family caregivers. It was presented to Stephen Snow at the Annual General Meeting of AMI-Quebec Action on Mental Illness on June 7.\nRelated Links\n"}

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.\n“Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in — even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,” says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.\n“Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.”\n \nHormones influence problem-solving\nFor the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a “hormonal profile” questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits.\nThe participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways.\nAt the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end.\nResults were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks.\nThat proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks — such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words — depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle.\nEssentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.\n“This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,” says Brake.\n“For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones”\n'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain'\nFor recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study’s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.\n“Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants — and male rats — in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,” she says.\n“I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.”\n"}

Just like Pavlov’s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink.\nIndeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .\n“Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,” says Nadia Chaudhri , the study’s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .\n“Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.”\nThe results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them.\nAccording to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn’t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.\n“Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,” Chaudhri explains.\n“These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.”\nFor the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol — the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks.\nThe researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue.\nThis happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered.\nThe researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable.\nSo how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?\n“Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,” says Chaudhri. “By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.”\nShe explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.\n“This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,” says Chaudhri.\n“Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.”\nChaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.\nRead the cited study here , led by Nadia Chaudhri, professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology . \n \n"}

The book’s findings have global implications for the study of mass violence and civil war, and will appeal to a wide variety of scholars, as well as to policy makers and NGO advocacy workers with interests in the possibilities and limits for preventing and/or stopping violence.\nFor more information about Violence as a Generative Force, see below and visit the book’s page on the Cornell University Press website:   http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100065060\nViolence as a Generative Force is also available as an ebook from Amazon/Kindle, Apple iBooks, Barnes & Noble/Nook, Google Play, and Kobo.\nAbout Violence as a Generative Force\nDuring two terrifying days and nights in early September 1941, the lives of nearly two thousand men, women, and children were taken savagely by their neighbors in Kulen Vakuf, a small rural community straddling today's border between northwest Bosnia and Croatia. This frenzy—in which victims were butchered with farm tools, drowned in rivers, and thrown into deep vertical caves—was the culmination of a chain of local massacres that began earlier in the summer. In Violence as a Generative Force, Max Bergholz tells the story of the sudden and perplexing descent of this once peaceful multiethnic community into extreme violence. This deeply researched microhistory provides provocative insights to questions of global significance: What causes intercommunal violence? How does such violence between neighbors affect their identities and relations?\nContrary to a widely held view that sees nationalism leading to violence, Bergholz reveals how the upheavals wrought by local killing actually created dramatically new perceptions of ethnicity—of oneself, supposed \"brothers,\" and those perceived as \"others.\" As a consequence, the violence forged new communities, new forms and configurations of power, and new practices of nationalism. The history of this community was marked by an unexpected explosion of locally executed violence by the few, which functioned as a generative force in transforming the identities, relations, and lives of the many. The story of this largely unknown Balkan community in 1941 provides a powerful means through which to rethink fundamental assumptions about the interrelationships among ethnicity, nationalism, and violence, both during World War II and more broadly throughout the world.\nAbout the Author\nMax Bergholz is Associate Professor of History at Concordia University in Montreal, where he holds the James M. Stanford Professorship in Genocide and Human Rights Studies. \nPraise for Violence as a Generative Force\n\"Violence as a Generative Force is a beautifully written, insightful, theoretically driven, compelling book. Max Bergholz is a gifted storyteller who lures the reader into a deeply complex story of multisided civil conflict, one that challenges presumptions about the processes and motives of violence.\"—Emily Greble, City College of New York, author of Sarajevo, 1941–1945: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Hitler's Europe\n\"Violence as a Generative Force sheds light on ethnic violence in original and illuminating ways. This remarkable book takes the gripping events in a small and often overlooked Bosnian community and places them in a startling new analytical perspective.\"—Edin Hajdarpasic, Loyola University Chicago, author of Whose Bosnia? Nationalism and Political Imagination in the Balkans, 1840–1914\n\"Violence in the Balkans has been overdescribed and underexplained. By dint of phenomenal research, vivid reconstruction, and meticulous analysis, Max Bergholz uncovers the truth about interethnic killing in a Bosnian provincial town during 1941. At once dispassionate, spirited, and profoundly responsible, his inquiry proves the transformative power of extreme violence to create identity. This excellent and enlightening book deserves the widest readership.\"—Mark Thompson, University of East Anglia, author of Birth Certificate and A Paper House\n\"Max Bergholz's Violence as a Generative Force is meticulously researched, engagingly written, and discerning in its judgments. It offers important new insights into the intercommunal violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina during World War II, but even more importantly it makes a significant contribution to the study of the dynamics of mass violence and how violence shapes identity and social relations in multiethnic societies. It should appeal to a wide multidisciplinary audience.\"—Mark Biondich, Institute of European, Russian and Eurasian Studies, Carleton University, author of The Balkans \n\"Violence as a Generative Force is a rare and challenging piece of scholarship: an ethnography of the past that shows how humans' darkest capabilities can also produce new forms of social solidarity. Max Bergholz asks very big questions about very small places, which is precisely the way to understand that most awful of social phenomena: the decision by one set of neighbors to throw another set down a cave.\"—Charles King, Georgetown University, author of Odessa and Midnight at the Pera Palace\n\"In this meticulously researched book, based on extensive archival work, Max Bergholz holds a microscope to a largely forgotten episode of violence in 1940s Bosnia. Informed by scholarship that spans multiple disciplines and regions, Bergholz's powerful analysis shows how violence shapes ethnicity—and in varied ways. While deeply anchored in Bosnia, this book has far-reaching implications for scholars of violence, social identity, and rural politics.\"—Scott Straus, University of Wisconsin–Madison, author of Making and Unmaking Nations  \nJoin the conversation\n"}

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

New students are accepted into our program by a faculty member willing to provide supervision and financial assistance. Each student is thus associated with a research team comprised of faculty and graduate students. A noteworthy feature of our program is that clinical students may study applied problems (e.g., child or adult psychopathology; high risk populations; adjustment in aging; health psychology) in their research teams, or they may also study more theoretical problems with humans (e.g., cognitive, social, and developmental processes; information processing and social cognition) or animals (e.g., appetitive motivation; drugs, hormones, and behaviour; reproductive behaviour).\nBecause entering students often have had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, by the time they complete the PhD degree they have achieved a high level of research specialization, and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, many have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences. There are several sources of funding for student travel to scientific conferences within the Department.

During the second year, students take courses in cognitive, behavioural, and other empirically supported treatments, receive practicum training in assessment and psychotherapy in the APC and, typically in the second summer, complete a full-time extramural clinical practicum. At the Ph.D. level, students also conduct their dissertation research, take advanced clinical and research seminars, participate in additional therapy practica, and write their Ph.D. comprehensive examinations. In the final year, students undertake a full-time, predoctoral internship (or two years half-time).

Clients at the APC are seen by graduate students under the supervision of clinical faculty. The types of services offered by the APC reflect the interests of clinical supervisors and students, and may include individual, family, or marital psychotherapy, cognitive-behaviour therapy for anxiety or stress, and treatment of child disorders.\nExternal training facilities\nExtramural practica, as well as an accredited senior predoctoral internship ( Concordia University Psychology Internship Programme ) may be carried out in a variety of local hospital settings. Some of the local sites where clinical graduate students are typically placed for external practica include:\nMcGill Mental Health Service - Clinical Psychology Practicum and Internship Program\nThe McGill Mental Health Service offers advanced clinical practica and internships to graduate students in Ph.D. Clinical Psychology programs. Our team consists of Psychologists, Psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Practicum students and interns are an integral and valued part of our team and we offer a warm and supportive environment. Given the breadth and depth of our program, we provide an excellent training opportunity for those who eventually want to work in private practice. We provide short and long-term psychological treatment to the undergraduate and graduate population at McGill University. We also have an emergency walk-in service. The population is extremely diverse: we treat clients from different cultural backgrounds and ages. Clients present with a wide range of Axis I and Axis II disorders. Students applying to our program should have a strong interest in the area of Adult/Young Adult mental health.\nRoyal Victoria Hospital\nThe Royal Victoria Hospital is a general hospital setting. Within Psychology, there are four distinct training programs, each with its own set of supervisors, seminars and clinical experiences. These programs include Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Adult Services Psychology, Sex and Couple Therapy as well as Child/Adolescent Psychology.\nMontreal Neurological Institute and Hospital\nThis setting is a specialized care hospital in Neurology and the practicum in Psychology is neuropsychological in emphasis. Most patients are assessed in order to determine whether they are suitable candidates for neuro-surgery. A variety of psychomotor and cognitive tests are administered. Both English and French test batteries are used. Neuropsychological assessment is the focus. Clients served include inpatients, epileptic patients, OCD patients, tourette syndrome patients, etc. The ages of clients served range from teenagers to the elderly.\nDouglas Hospital\nThe Douglas Hospital is one of the largest Psychiatric Hospital Centres in Montreal.

Made in the UK between 1975-1978 while Marshall was teaching at Newcastle Polytechnic, these works reference Bruce Nauman's earlier Lip Sync from 1969, or the early video works of William Wegman. Parallel works Mouth Room and Arcanum illustrate Marshall's debt to feminist video practice and the 'semanalysis' theories of Julia Kristeva, with art as a signifying and re-signifying practice, as conveyed through Marshall's video theory in development at the same time. Retrospectively, Marshall's refrain of '...go through the motions of saying one thing and meaning another...' bespeaks the closet and the possibility of transformation. \"Go Through The Motions\" establishes the conceptual content and visual economy later explored by Marshall's \"Journal of the Plague Year\" and \"Pedagogue\".\n\"Pedagogue\", 1988, 11 min.\n\"Pedagogue\" is a 1988 collaboration between Stuart Marshall, author, playwright and performer Neil Bartlett (b.1958), and students at Newcastle Polytechnic. Marshall and Bartlett conceived Pedagogue as an improvised, agit-prop video to “cock a snook” at the Thatcher government's Section 28, in progress at the time. Section 28 was a repressive, homophobic legislation prohibiting the promotion of homosexual lifestyles that tried to turn the tide on two decades of LGBT political gains. By seeking to expose the absurdity of Section 28 Pedagogue humorously evokes the cultural opposition to regressive homophobic and anti-sex attitudes of the Thatcher's Britain promulgated in the right-wing press during the AIDS crisis. As a contemporary account states this 'deconstructs the two establishment myths that homosexuality can be \"taught\" and is \"infectious,\" thereby returning to pedagogical and pathological ideas of homosexuality, first explored in \"Bright Eyes\". (Quote from Between Imagination and Reality, ICA 1990.)\n\"Bright Eyes\", 1984, 80 min.\n\"Bright Eyes\" was commissioned by and first broadcast on UK television's Channel 4 in December 1984 in the context of a virulently homophobic media response to the emergence of HIV/AIDS. Marshall's innovative and experimental video-essay charts the media depiction of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease within the long durée of homosexual stigmatization and pathologization. For Marshall this entails earlier attempted sexual reform movements, political repression, ongoing censorship and entrapment. As a history of the present \"Bright Eyes\" combines archival material, historical reenactment and agit-prop theatricality with interviews featuring those on the frontline of the UK and US AIDS crisis such as lesbian and gay activists, health workers and people with AIDS. At the time, Marshall's historical, political and cultural analysis, radical image-text juxtapositions and intertextuality broke the mould and demanded an ethical and political response from its viewers. Displaying polemical attitude, artistic flair and intellectual acuity, \"Bright Eyes\" set the tone for AIDS cultural activism and analysis and continues to resonate with ongoing representations of HIV/AIDS and LGBTQI issues.\nProgram 2 — 17h:\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\", 1991. 74 min.\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\" is Marshall's follow-up to Bright Eyes commissioned by and broadcast through dedicated lesbian and gay magazine OUT on UK Television's Channel 4 in August 1991. Documenting the rise of US AIDS activism and the corresponding UK activist scene, Marshall features extensive interviews with members of ACT UP, QUEER NATION, their UK chapters and corresponding UK activist group OutRage! AIDS activist and OutRage co-founder Simon Watney maps out the US and UK scenes, while activist video by ACT UP and OutRage! members and affiliated groups demonstrates the step-change in the cultural and political self-articulation and self-determination of AIDS activism.\n\"Robert Marshall\", 1991, 10 min.\n\"Robert Marshall\", (filmed with the assistance of John Greyson) charts Stuart Marshall's journey to make a video and visit family in Canada. Here Marshall seeks out 8mm film footage of his earlier family life that includes his deceased father Robert, who died in the filmmaker's company during childhood. Marshall's Barthesian narrative is a eulogy to his father, a paean to the power of the moving image, an account of Marshall's alternative medical treatment for AIDS at the same time as offering a poignant reflection on mortality and memory. Influenced by the writings of the women's health movement and Susan Sontag's Illness As Metaphor Marshall states, 'I believe that one should take some control over one's own disease process.' As such, Robert Marshall parallels the work of UK artist Jo Spence, displaying a historically committed, materialist regard for ethical convictions and political content. These works ask who goes before and what comes after us, while remaining indicative of Marshall's singular and unfaded polemical, critical and artistic abilities.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThis retrospective is an event in conjunction with the public lecture:\n\"Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism and the AIDS Crisis:\nLearning in a Public Medium \"\n"}

Once fabrics are produced, garments or “end uses” are described. “End uses” can be developed to create beautiful fashion garments to everyday basic apparel.

The subsequent objectives were: i) to reduce the initial concentration of carbon, nutrients, and color-forming substances compared to conventional treatment systems, ii) to investigate removal mechanisms in the new system under electric field, iii) to optimize the system by studying the relationship between various operating parameters. To achieve these objectives an innovative compact electro-anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EAnMBR) was designed and its high performance was researched in two operational configurations. In the EAnMBR, physicochemical, biological and electrokinetic processes interacted simultaneously permitting to control the effluent quality and sludge properties. The dark-color molasses-based wastewater containing the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (53,000 mgL-1), total nitrogen (2,300 mgL-1), total phosphorus (150 mgL-1), was selected for this research and submitted to multi-phase studies. The research allowed to define optimal operational conditions leading to removal of carbon, nutrients by 99% and to complete discoloration in the EAnMBR system. The novel system was compared with anaerobic membrane bioreactor showing performance superiority of EAnMBR in respect to COD, sludge volume reduction and filterability by 10%, 54% and 7%, respectively. A separate experimental phase was dedicated to optimize the energy balance in the novel system by the surface response method. The EAnMBR demonstrated outstanding results which make it a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for various applications, e.g. in food, agriculture and defence industries.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The name ‘Vichy’ soon came to be used to refer to the regime instigated by Pétain and his ministers. The shortcut was maintained and popularized in the postwar period, to the great displeasure of the Vichyssois, who have long been refusing to incorporate the war into the city’s history. Whereas the Vichy regime is considered one of the most defining historical events of France’s recent past, in the French memorial landscape of the Second World War, the city of Vichy continues to stand out as a non lieu de mémoire.\nThis dissertation investigates the wartime period in Vichy and explores how the population has dealt with the fraught legacy of the Vichy regime from 1944 to the present. My research examines how the interaction between national mythology, specific local concerns, and broader troubling issues have impacted – and often blocked – the formation of a local war memory. In the immediate postwar years, local resisters strove to establish a strong memory of the resistance. At the same time, a powerful victimhood myth emerged in response to the city’s fears of stigmatization and ostracism. The spa tourism’s recovery in the early 1950s marked a significant change in the city’s memorial politics, leading to the memory of the war being pushed into the background, thereby establishing a tradition of silence in Vichy. This, however, does not mean that the memories of the war never resurfaced. They did, especially during the Algerian War. In the 1950s, Vichy’s economy largely depended on colonial spa tourism. Known as the “Capitale d’été de l’Afrique du Nord,” Vichy was indeed a privileged summer destination for thousands of settlers, especially pieds noirs from Algeria. The fear provoked by the prospect of a grave economic crisis in the event that Algeria would become independent led to a rightward shift of the population. This shift provided the ideal environment for a pro-Pétain memory to gather strength in Vichy, beyond Pétain’s traditional extreme right base. While in the 1950s, Pétain’s myth also enjoyed a revival of popularity in France, it declined rapidly, when, following the end of the Algerian War, the extreme right hit historical lows. In Vichy, on the other hand, this counter memory continued to develop in the 1960s. In the post 1970s period, although the local Petainist memory went underground, no other memory has risen to occupy a central place in the local collective remembering of the war, turning the city into a non lieu de mémoire and making it a counter example of what has been happening in many other places across Europe, where the most shameful aspects of the Second World War have been memorialized.\nWhere\nRoom GM 930.48, Guy-De Maisonneuve Building (1550 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMost of the Researchers’ interest is focusing on Bridge Management System (BMS), by its Maintenance, Repair & Rehabilitation (MR&R) segments, while a good practice of bridge management should cover the conceptual design phase of a new bridge. Although conceptual design is one stage of a bridge life whereas there is still limited knowledge on how it should be conducted. Most often engineers’ decisions are based on their past experience and standard solutions, which are affected by the subjectivity. This approach, most probably, does not reflect the effective way to address different problems of consistency in the decision. To design a new bridge, many factors, like the cost and aesthetic behavior, have to be considered due to their ability to affect the final decision. Generally, decision-makers will make their final design and decisions based on those factors in addition to human subjectivity.\nThe objective of this research is to propose a methodology to develop systematic procedures that can help decision-makers select the most appropriate bridge type with its diverse components and to forecast its Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and other characteristics such as the public satisfaction and environment sustainability of the selected bridge type. The proposed methodology integrates a decision support system with a relevant database within an artificial intelligence environment (AI) and bridge information management tools in order to reduce the impact of human subjectivity on the decision taken during the conceptual design stage of bridges life.\nFor this purpose, Machine Learning technique, which is a part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) environment, will be the core of the proposed methodology. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with its back-propagation algorithm is adopted in order to identify the appropriate solution by setting up its engine guidelines. A polynomial regression method will first be integrated in the DSS: 1) to formulate the database in order to establish the needed functions; 2) to define the input values for the ANN; and 3) to verify the intermediate ANN weightiness of the proposed methodology engine based on historic data retrieved from the database. An investigation will be conducted in order to define bridge characteristics and parameters, to be used in the ANN, and that affect the final decision.\nElements of the ANN layers (Engine model) which include: Input, Hidden & output layers, have to be described based on a systematic and standardized process. The proposed methodology has the potential to be used in lower levels to determine other bridge components such as vertical structures, foundations and connection types. The objectives of the proposed methodology can be summarized as follow:\nAvoiding, as much as possible, the influence of human subjectivity on the decision-making process.\nListing and Ranking all the other possible alternatives.\nEnsuring equivalent and fair consideration for all factors affecting the decision, and especially reducing the possibility to miss and overlook the impact of some factors that could be ignored while proceeding with making the right decision by using conventional decision-making approaches.\nDeveloping a model that can be considered as a guideline for further use that can be applied within any decision-making environment and based on a relevant historic database and experts’ input.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMany industrial systems are nonlinear with “slow” and “fast” dynamics because of the presence of some “parasitic” parameters. These systems are usually labeled as “singularly perturbed” or “multi-time-scale” systems. Singular perturbation theory has been proved to be a useful tool to control and analyze singularly perturbed systems if the full knowledge of the system model parameters is available. However, the accurate and faithful mathematical models of those systems are usually difficult to obtain due to the uncertainties and nonlinearities.\nTo obtain the accurate system models, in this research, a new identification scheme for the discrete time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural network and optimal bounded ellipsoid method is proposed firstly. Compared with other gradient descent based identification schemes, the new identification method proposed in this research can achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain. Later, the optimal bounded ellipsoid based identification method for discrete time systems is extended to the identification of continuous singularly perturbed systems. Subsequently, by adding two additional terms in the weight’s updating laws, a modified identification scheme is proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the identification algorithm during the whole identification process. Lastly, through introducing some filtered variables, a robust neural network training algorithm is proposed for the system identification problem subjected to measurement noises.\nBased on the identification results, the singular perturbation theory is introduced to decompose a high order multi-time-scale system into two low order subsystems – the reduced slow subsystem and the reduced fast subsystem. Then, two controllers are designed for the two subsystems separately. By using the singular perturbation theory, an adaptive controller for a regulation problem is designed in this research firstly. Because the system order is reduced, the adaptive controller proposed in this research has a simpler structure and requires much less computational resources, compared with other conventional controllers. Afterwards, an indirect adaptive controller is proposed for solving the trajectory tracking problem. The stability of both identification and control schemes are analyzed through the Lyapunov approach, and the effectiveness of the identification and control algorithms are demonstrated using simulations and experiments.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nAn effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) technology can play a crucial role in improving the system availability, safety and reliability as well as reducing the risks of catastrophic failures. In this thesis, the robust sensor FDI problem of gas turbine engines is investigated and different novel techniques are developed to address the effects of parameter uncertainties, disturbances as well as process and measurement noise on the performance of FDI strategies. The efficiencies of proposed techniques are investigated through extensive simulation studies for the single spool gas turbine engine that is previously developed and validated using the GSP software. The gas turbine engine health degradation is considered in various forms in this thesis. First, it is considered as a part of the engine dynamics that is estimated off-line and updated periodically for the on-board engine model. Second, it is modeled as the time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty that affects all the system state-space matrices and third as an unknown nonlinear dynamic that is approximated by the use of a dynamic recurrent neural network.\nIn the first part of the thesis, we propose a hybrid Kalman filter (HKF) scheme that consists of a single nonlinear on-board engine model (OBEM) augmented with piecewise linear (PWL) models constituting as the multiple model (MM) based estimators to cover the entire engine operating regime. We have integrated the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based method with our MM-based scheme to estimate the sensor fault severity under various single and concurrent fault scenarios. In order to ensure the reliability of our proposed HKF-based FDI scheme during the engine life cycle, it is assumed that the reference baselines are periodically updated for the OBEM health parameters.\nIn the second part of the thesis, a novel robust sensor FDI strategy using the MM-based approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for mul- tiple PWL models. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibil- ity conditions. The main objective is to propose a robust filter that satisfies the overall performance requirements and is not affected by system perturbations. The requirements include a quadratically stable filter that ensures bounded estimation error variances having predefined values.\nIn the third part of the thesis, a novel hybrid approach is proposed to improve the robustness of FDI scheme with respect to different sources of uncertainties. For this purpose, a dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) is designed to ap- proximate the gas turbine engine uncertainty due to the health degradations. The proposed DRNN is trained offline by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) al- gorithm for an engine with different levels of uncertainty, but with healthy sensors. The convergence of EKF-based DRNN training algorithm is also investigated. Then, the trained DRNN with the fixed parameters and topology is integrated with our online model-based FDI algorithm to approximate the uncertainty terms of the real engine. In this part, the previously proposed HKF and RKF are integrated with the trained DRNN to construct the hybrid FDI structure.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis thesis contributes and provides solutions to the problem of fault diagnosis and estimation from three different perspectives which are i) fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using nonlinear multiple model approach, ii) inversion-based fault estimation in linear systems, and iii) data-driven fault diagnosis and estimation in linear systems. The above contributions have been demonstrated to the gas turbines as one of the most important engineering systems in the power and aerospace industries.\nThe proposed multiple model approach is essentially a hierarchy of nonlinear Kalman filters utilized as detection filters. A nonlinear mathematical model for a gas turbines is developed and verified. The fault vector is defined using the Gas Path Analysis approach. The nonlinear Kalman filters that correspond to the defined single or concurrent fault modes provide the conditional probabilities associated with each fault mode using the Bayes’ law. The current fault mode is then determined based on the maximum probability criteria. The performance of both Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are investigated and compared which demonstrates that the UKF outperforms the EKF for this particular application.\nThe problem of fault estimation is increasingly receiving more attention due to its practical importance. Fault estimation is closely related to the problem of linear systems inversion. This thesis includes two contributions for the stable inversion of non-minimum phase systems. First, a novel methodology is proposed for direct estimation of unknown inputs by using only measurements of either minimum or non-minimum phase systems as well as systems with transmission zeros on the unit circle. A dynamic filter is then identified whose poles coincide with the transmission zeros of the system. A feedback is then introduced to stabilize the above filter dynamics as well as provide an unbiased estimation of the unknown input. The methodology is then applied to the problem of fault estimation and has been shown that the proposed inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of faults. Second, a solution for unbiased reconstruction of general inputs is proposed. It is based on designing an unknown input observer (UIO) that provides unbiased estimation of the minimum phase states of the system. The reconstructed minimum phase states serve then as inputs for reconstruction of the non-minimum phase states. The reconstruction error for non-minimum phase states exponentially decrease as the estimation delay is increased. Therefore, an almost perfect reconstruction can be achieved by selecting the delay to be sufficiently large. The proposed inversion scheme is then applied to the output-tracking control problem.\nAn important practical challenge is the fact that engineers rarely have a detailed and accurate mathematical model of complex engineering systems such as gas turbines. Consequently, one can find a trend towards data-driven approaches in many disciplines, including fault diagnosis. In this thesis, explicit state-space based fault detection, isolation and estimation filters are proposed that are directly identified from only the system input-output (I/O) measurements and through the system Markov parameters. The proposed procedures do not involve a reduction step and do not require identification of the system extended observability matrix or its left null space. Therefore, the performance of the proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the errors in the Markov parameters estimation process. The estimation error dynamics is then derived in terms of the Markov parameters identification errors and directly synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation errors have been effectively compensated for. The proposed data-driven scheme requires the persistently exciting condition for healthy input data which is not practical for certain real life applications and in particular to gas turbine engines. To address this issue, a robust methodology for Markov parameters estimation using frequency response data is developed. Finally, the performance of the proposed data-driven approach is comprehensively evaluated for the fault diagnosis and estimation problems in the gas turbine engines.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

These systems can be reversibly and controllably transformed between several different stable conformations, and will respond to orthogonal stimuli. The synthesis, electronic properties, and switching characteristics of several responsive IIN-containing small molecules will be presented. \n \nBio\nSara Eisler obtained her BSc. from the University of Alberta in 1998.

D. A post-doctoral position at ETH-Zürich in the group of Prof. François Diederich followed, where organic materials chemistry (and alkynes) were set aside to investigate gene transfection vectors. She subsequently moved to Montreal in 2006 to work with Professor Jim Wuest to study crystal engineering. Since joining the faculty at the University of New Brunswick in 2008 as an assistant professor, she has continued to design and synthesize organic materials.

Kristin is on the board of directors of the  Borneo Orangutan Society Canada , and the author of two books on the philosophy of animal minds.\nAbstract:\nTraditionally, discussions of moral participation – and in particular moral agency – have focused on fully formed human actors. There has been some interest in the development of morality in humans, as well as interest in cultural differences when it comes to moral practices, commitments, and actions. However, until relatively recently there has been little focus on the possibility that nonhuman animals have any role to play in morality, save being the object of moral concern. Moreover, when nonhuman cases are considered as evidence of moral agency or subjecthood, there has been a tendency to focus on higher-order moral behaviors (i.e., those same behaviors that inform our views about human moral agency). If we are to understand the evolution of moral psychology and moral practice, then this relative lack of attention to the practices of other animals and this persistent focus on the moral instead of the normative have been great oversights.\nA biologically responsible way of examining the distribution of moral practice in other animals starts from considering the distribution of normative practice across species. Drawing on the work of psychologists and anthropologists, the normative foundations of morality across humans demonstrates that some animals—chimpanzees and cetaceans in particular—demonstrate many of the moral foundations that indicate the existence of a cognitive modality I call naïve normativity.\nWhere\nRoom 201, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis dissertation analyzes the convoluted process by which Irish nationalists, Irish unionists, and British politicians negotiated Irish self-government in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In December 1909, a modest form of self-government known as home rule within the British Empire for all of Ireland became a practical issue in United Kingdom politics again, after the failure of two previous home rule bills in 1886 and 1893. After a decade that witnessed a world war and a revolution in Ireland, two new Irish polities emerged by June 1922. Northern Ireland, a majority-unionist state comprised of six counties in the province of Ulster, acquired a limited form of home rule within the United Kingdom. Covering the rest of the island, the Irish Free State secured significant control of its domestic affairs as a dominion of the British Empire, though not the complete independence demanded by Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had waged the revolution.\nHow did the main political parties and actors in Britain and Ireland arrive at this settlement, especially as it was so different from how elites had envisioned Irish self-government in 1909? Using archival material and public discourse, this dissertation seeks to answer this question by methodically analyzing the political decisions taken by British and Irish political parties and movements between 1909 and 1922. It challenges historical conceptions that the settlement enacted by the Government of Ireland Act (1920) and the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) was an inevitable evolution in Anglo-Irish relations, that it marks the British government’s recognition of the Irish right to self-determination, or the triumph of Irish democracy. Instead, I argue that the settlement was highly contingent upon prevailing political circumstances, heavily influenced by British interests, and often defied the democratic demands of Irish people, both nationalist and unionist. Partition, the separation of Ireland into two different states, was achieved through the acquiescence of British politicians to the demands of Ulster unionist leaders, without reference to public opinion in any part of Ireland.\nWhere\nRoom H 1001.01, Henry F.

Re-search-for-design is defined as a research activity performed by the designer in order to inform the design process. This study aims to better understand the contribution of research-for-design education, not only as a required activity in the design process, but also as a strategy to develop a vision for sustainable design. This comparative study examined two university design programs, the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí in San Luis Potosí, Mexico. I examined student and teacher accounts of how research is taught in each program. Through a process of comparative analysis, I identified differences in the participating students and educators’ backgrounds and design streams which led to varied perspectives of disciplinary practice. Formal and informal methods of doing research-for-design were identified and linked to accounts of teaching and learning. These practices in the education of research-for-design included intuitive, informal, spontaneous, ludic, innovative, visual, creative, social, and emphatic strategies. Teaching research-for-design demands an effective way to connect students with their entire environment. By doing this, the education of research-for-design will empower students’ understanding of the design process with the potential to promote ethical, sustainable, comprehensive, and integrative design.\nWhere\nRoom EV 2.776, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis thesis collects three articles that explore the construct of reflected appraisal –individuals’ beliefs about how they are seen in the eyes of others. These manuscripts are linked by the overarching question “How do employees manage the bombardment of myriad reflected appraisals in their daily organizational lives?” To address this, the articles examine four workplace manifestations of reflected that are represented by the constructs of perceived supervisor support, organizational support, respect and external prestige (also called image) while considering the referents inherent in each construct (i.e., Co-workers, team members, the employing organization and external stakeholders). The theoretical manuscript (article 1) examines the four reflected appraisals together, asking what contextual and individual factors predict which reflected appraisals employees are more likely to focus on and when. We use employees’ work-roles as the key construct that links these factors together, arguing that self-motives drive individuals to focus on some reflected appraisals under the constraint of accountability and interdependence that are part of the organizational structure. The quantitative manuscript (article 2) examines the concurrent impact of respect and prestige on relational and organizational identification. In a survey of student-athletes from varsity sports teams, we found that the matching principle prevailed: Prestige and respect that are focused on the relationship predicted relational identification while respect and prestige focused on the collective predicted organizational identification. However, prestige was the better predictor of both the relational and organizational foci. The qualitative manuscript (article 3) focuses on organizational image and explores how individuals respond to perceived organizational stigma. I interviewed employees of general contractors during a city-wide scandal in which various audiences marked their organizations as “the enemy” by virtue of their category-membership. I found that interviewees negotiated two images that embodied individuating and de-individuating reflected appraisals of their organization. Furthermore, employees constructed these images using various sources of information that they integrated into their reflected appraisals. Overall, the three articles demonstrate that employees actively engage with a plethora of reflected appraisals from multiple referents in the organizational environment.\nWhere\nRoom MB 12.101, John Molson Building (1450 Guy), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

It does this by engaging current scholarship on “Comedy,” building upon some of its fundamentals, yet showing that the picture we get of “Comedy” in this literature should be supplemented. To this end, the paper explicates Hegel’s claim that the individual is a “negative power,” and then develops a central point in Hegel’s section on “Comedy,” namely, that in comedy abstract universals are put in play and revealed as they are actually made concrete in the lives of individuals. This reveals the pretensions of abstract universals, unmasking the gap between what we might think of a universal, such as honesty, and this universal in it concrete/actual form. It this pretense and gap that Hegel finds comedic.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

Gavin is completing his MA in Philosophy at Concordia.\nAbstract:\nWhat is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia manifests differently in different cultures, according to different modes of understanding. Modern scientific understandings of the disease categorize it as a neurological disorder, primarily biological or genetic in nature, with the experience of the disease manifesting in the ‘split mind(s)’ (schizo- phrēne) of patients. But there is mounting empirical evidence to suggest that biogenetic and neurologically reductive approaches are limited with respect to their treatment outcomes, and – as I argue – specifically alienating to patients. Patients are faced both with social alienation, and a sense of alienation from self – I argue that this is primarily by the disease’s interaction with its cultural and political situatedness, rather than by the manifestation of disease itself. Leaning on Marx and Foucault, I seek to readdress the question of schizophrenic ontology in this essay, motivating for a model that will attenuate the experience of alienation thought symptomatic of schizophrenia by approaching it as dialectical co-production of both biogenetic, and sociocultural factors. The result is to argue for the irreducibility of the experience of vulnerability in future research seeking to open up treatment options for patients with schizophrenia.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

This fact highlights the importance of improving indoor air quality (IAQ) in in areas including sustainable buildings. Among different air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a major part of indoor pollutants. The proven negative impact of these compounds in occupants’ health has motivated researchers to develop different air treatment technologies for the removal of VOCs.\nDevelopment of plasma-based methods, and their remarkable capabilities for VOCs degradation, has motivated designers to employ these methods as indoor air purification. It has been demonstrated that utilizing a dual functional adsorbent/catalyst (DFA/C) in a plasma system can significantly enhance the VOCs removal and energy efficiency of such an air purifier. However, selecting an appropriate DFA/C is a challenge to achieve the best performance in these systems.\nFor the first time, this research attempted to utilize metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as DFA/Cs for a plasma-driven catalytic reactor. Accordingly, three different MOFs, MIL-101 (MIL: Metal institute Lavoisier), MIL-53, and CPM-5 (CPM: Crystalline Porous Material-5), were synthesized through microwave, solvothermal and mechanochemical methods. To test the performance of these DFA/Cs, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was designed and implemented as a non-thermal plasma (NTP) set-up. During preparation and evaluation experiments, different characterization and analytical instruments, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatogram/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS), Ozone monitor, and VOC Photoionization detector (PID), were utilized.\nSeveral adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted to study physical and chemical behaviors of MOFs for the removal of one (1) ppm toluene and isobutanol on MIL-101, MIL-53 and CPM-5. Also, the effect of the presence of 30% relative humidity on the adsorption capacity and oxidation ability of each MOF was investigated. Results showed physisorption of VOCs on all MOFs during the course of adsorption tests. Moreover, the stable structure of the examined MOFs before and after plasma-catalytic reactions indicated a facile regeneration of catalysts. During the plasma-catalytic oxidation of toluene and isobutanol, different organic by-products and ozone were detected either in dry or humid conditions for all MOFs.\nMIL-101 and MIL-53 exhibited much higher adsorption and oxidation ability compared to CPM-5 in most of the experiments. Results demonstrated a higher adsorption capacity and almost the same oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 compared to MIL-53 in dry air. Nevertheless, the negative influence of humidity on adsorption and oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 was more significant than in MIL-53.\nIn conclusion, results demonstrated the potential capacity of MOFs as DFA/Cs in a NTP system.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nA growing number of recalcitrant pollutants of both human health and environmental concern (e.g., pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals) are being introduced to Canadian and global water and wastewater systems at an alarming rate. While conventional water and wastewater treatment technologies are effective at providing clean, usable water, these methods are inadequate for the complete removal of these emerging aquatic contaminants. Unlike naturally occurring aquatic organic compounds, these emerging contaminants must not only be removed from aqueous systems but also degraded to non-toxic constituent compounds. Membrane filtration is currently one of the most effective technologies for water purification, but conventional membranes lack mechanisms for contaminant degradation. Many environmental contaminants are highly susceptible to aggressive oxidative or reductive degradation. This is achievable with electro-filtration along with electro-enhanced oxidation and reduction processes.\nElectrochemical filtration is a promising technology that aims for the efficient removal of persistent contaminants that cannot be effectively eliminated through conventional treatment methods. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and carbon substrates can be employed as filtration media to which a DC potential can be applied for further electrochemical treatment.\nThis study consists of two main objectives: firstly, an investigation of MWNTs and carbon substrates and the use of electrochemical filtration in dead-end filtration systems, and secondly, the application of the same technologies in crossflow filtration systems for the removal and degradation of model persistent organic contaminants. Through the course of the study, MWNTs were employed as filtration media and tested under different surface conditions and solution chemistries with the aim of achieving the most effective elimination of the model persistent organic contaminants.\nIbuprofen and Bisphenol A, two emerging contaminants of concern, have been reported to exist in natural waters, influent, secondary treated effluent of wastewater, and in primary and secondary wastewater sludge. In this study, dead-end electrochemical filtration was investigated as a removal method for these contaminants. This technique has shown promise in the elimination of both of these compounds and the reduction of their overall toxicity. In these dead-end electrochemical filtration experiments, we employed multiwalled carbon nanotubes as both a filtration and electrode material. As well, the stability of MWNTs was studied under different surface and bulk structural conditions.\nCarboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs-COOH) were used with the aim of increasing the filtration efficiency for the removal of carboxylated ibuprofen under different pH and electrolytic conditions. It was found that the presence of oxy-functional groups can increase the functional surface area of MWNTs and increase the filtration capacity in low voltage applications. In high voltage applications, it was found that electrochemical filtration is controlled by bulk electroactive species. Boron doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (BMWNTs) were also studied, with the goal of improving electrical conductivity during bisphenol A electrochemical filtration experiments. It was found that despite previous reports describing the higher oxidative power of doped carbon nanotubes, with the highest reported for BMWNTs, pristine MWNTs and BMWNTs showed similar outcomes in eliminating bisphenol A. The results indicate adequate performance and efficiency of pristine MWNTs in removing bisphenol A. These results demonstrate the dead-end electrochemical filtration as a promising technology for the removal of these emerging contaminants.\nThe removal of ibuprofen and bisphenol A was also investigated by using crossflow electrochemical filtration for individual and equimolar mixture solutions. The aim was, firstly, to investigate electrochemical filtration performance under the horizontal shear flow mechanism in a flat sheet crossflow setup. Large surface area, superconductive MWNT blend buckypaper membranes were used as electrochemical filtration electrodes.\nThe crossflow configuration shows great potential in eliminating these two contaminants in both individual component and mixed solutions from pure and fouling electrolytes. This outcome can mainly be attributed to the crossflow mechanism and can be assigned to the horizontal shear flow, which likely leads to a consistent surface coverage, combined with the greater conductivity of the MWNT blend buckypaper membrane. The long residence time within the membrane likely leads to a significant reduction in toxicity under applied voltage. Our results suggest that the electrochemical filtration technology based on MWNTs has a potential for use as a polishing step for removal of emerging contaminants from natural waters and secondary wastewater effluents.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

Photo: Guy L'Heureux.\nEN\nFor over three decades, the annual undergraduate exhibition has presented works by students in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University. In recent years, the initiative has expanded to include writers from the department of Art History and designers from the department of Design and Computation Arts. Together, a uniquely designed catalogue illustrates the diversity of works and texts that reveal the breadth of talent found within the faculty of fine arts.\nWe are pleased to introduce a new layer to this year’s iteration and are working with performers from Concordia’s department of Contemporary Dance. As such, the growing collaboration has compelled us to come up with a theme to unify the participating disciplines. The thematic of “space” was introduced to encourage thought-provoking concepts that stem from notions of space, which has the potential to be interpreted broadly within various creative practices. For example, there is the space between generations, pictorial space, the space between performer and audience, geographic space, queer space, political space, outer space, to name only a few.\nThe FOFA Gallery salutes the extraordinary work of the artists, writers, designers and dancers proving that cross-disciplinary practice continues to be an engaging approach within the creative process. We also wish to acknowledge the dedicated guidance from professors in all of these departments who have inspired a dynamic illustration of current interests and artistic explorations.\nFaire des espaces\nExposition des étudiants et étudiantes de premier cycle\nDu 16 janvier au 17 février 2017\nFR\nDepuis plus de trente ans, les étudiantes et étudiants de 1er cycle de la Faculté des beaux-arts de l’Université Concordia présentent leurs œuvres dans le cadre d’une exposition annuelle. Ces dernières années, l’initiative s’est enrichie de la contribution de rédacteurs du Département d’histoire de l’art et de designers du Département de design et d’arts numériques. Ensemble, ceux-ci réalisent un catalogue original où œuvres, textes et facture graphique mettent en lumière l’ampleur des talents issus de la faculté.\nC’est avec plaisir que nous ajoutons un nouveau volet à l’édition de cette année grâce à l’apport d’artistes du Département de danse contemporaine. Pour nourrir cette collaboration florissante, nous avons jugé utile de choisir un thème qui unifierait les disciplines participantes. Ainsi, nous avons mis de l’avant le concept d’« espace » afin d’encourager la réflexion sur un sujet se prêtant à une multitude d’interprétations au sein de diverses pratiques créatives. Par exemple, l’espace entre les générations, l’espace pictural, l’espace entre l’artiste et le public, l’espace géographique, l’espace queer, l’espace politique ou l’espace extraterrestre.\nLa Galerie FOFA salue le travail extraordinaire des artistes, rédacteurs, designers et danseurs, qui prouve que le croisement des disciplines demeure une démarche stimulante dans le processus de création. Nous souhaitons enfin remercier les membres du corps professoral des divers départements, dont le soutien dévoué a inspiré cette illustration dynamique des réflexions théoriques et des explorations artistiques de l’heure.\nArtists / Artistes\nLand of Plenty (detail) (2016), Jordan Beaulieu.

He will offer his perspective on the process consulting stance and on the dilemmas that often arise when a consultant intervenes in complex social systems. Conklin will suggest that the skilled intervener engages in four critical balancing acts:\nBalancing the need to challenge and at times push the client toward success with the need to create safety and to show compassion for the client. The intervener is confrontational and compassionate.\nBalancing the need to engage in planned and intentional activity with the need to be open to the emergent and unexpected. The intervener stays the course and changes course.\nBalancing the need to become part of the client system with the need to remain distinct and apart. The intervener participates and observes.\nBalancing the inclination to tell the client the solution to client problems with the need to create the conditions in which members of the client system can discover the answers for themselves. The intervener asserts and inquires.\nThe evening will allow participants to consider the strengths and opportunities that await those who wish to become more conscious and effective facilitators of social change.\nWhere\nRoom RF-100, Loyola Jesuit Hall and Conference Centre (7141 Sherbrooke W.),\nSpeakers\n"}

But for most university students, the coming weeks mean final exams , mounting stress and negative moods .\nWhile that doesn’t seem like an ideal combination for great grades, new Concordia research shows that the occasional bout of bad feelings can actually improve students’ academic success.\nA study published in Developmental Psychology by Erin Barker , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science , shows that students who were mostly happy during their four years of university but who also experienced occasional negative moods had the highest GPAs at the time of graduation.\nIn contrast, the study also confirmed that students who experienced high levels of negative moods and low levels of positive moods often ended up with the lowest GPAs — a pattern consistent with depressive disorders.\n“Students often report feeling overwhelmed and experiencing high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms,” says Barker, who is also a member of the Centre for Research in Human Development .\n“This study shows that we need to teach them strategies to both manage negative emotions and stress in productive ways, and to maintain positive emotional experiences.”\nFor the study, Barker and her co-authors* worked with 187 first-year students at a large university. The researchers tracked the students throughout their four years of schooling by having them complete questionnaires about recent emotional experiences each year, beginning in the first year and continuing throughout their undergraduate degree.\n \nNegative emotions signal a challenge\n“We looked at students’ response patterns to better understand how experiences of positive and negative emotions occurred over time. We then combined average patterns to look how each person varied from their own average and examined different combinations of trait and state affects together,” Barker explains.\n“This allowed us to identify the pattern associated with the greatest academic success: those who were happy for the most part, but who also showed bouts of elevated negative moods.”\nThese findings demonstrate that both negative and positive emotions play a role in our successes.\n“We often think that feeling bad is bad for us. But if you're generally a happy person, negative emotions can be motivating. They can signal to you that there is a challenge that you need to face. Happy people usually have coping resources and support that they draw on to meet that challenge.”\nIn January, Barker and psychology graduate students Sarah Newcomb-Anjo and Kate Mulvihill will expand on this research by launching a new study focused on life beyond graduation. Their plan: examine patterns of emotional experience and well-being as former students navigate new challenges associated with finding work or entering a post-graduation program.\n*Partners in research: This study was co-authored by Carsten Wrosch , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, Andrea L. Howard from Carleton University and Nancy L. Galambos from the University of Alberta. The research was funded by a grant awarded to N. Galambos by the the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. \nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

It's sponsored in part by Clinical Projects Grant from the Ordre régional des infirmières et infirmiers de Montréal/Laval, as well the CSU Special Projects fund. The CSU, Queer Concordia , Health Services and the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association (CUPA) are collaborating to run the testing events.\nTo choose from a variety of free condoms at the give-away, simply go to the Atrium of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) on the Sir George Williams Campus. You can always get free condoms at the weekly Healthy YOU at CU information table, or come by Health Services Condom Boutique where you can choose from a variety of condoms, \"3-for-$1\"!\n“The goal is to remind students that regular STI testing is a normal part of taking care of your health, just like going to the dentist,” says Gabriella Szabo, health promotion specialist with  Health Services . “And students get their results in 20 minutes, rather than 10 days.”\nBe informed and empowered\nDecember 1 is World Aids Day and a perfect occasion to have a clear-headed conversation about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). CATIE , a Canadian online source for information and resources about HIV and AIDS, is a good place to learn more about the history and contemporary reality of the disease.\nThe Concordia University Community Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS has its fourth event on December 1 from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Museum of Fine Arts. London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium.\nConsent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events.\nAt the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained: “We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,” she says.\n“Outreach activities like this are also great opportunities to start important conversations and provide information about consent, bystander intervention and preventing sexual violence.”\n \nLearn more about safe sex by reading Health Service’s 16 Safer Sex Practices .\n \n"}

People don’t judge you.”\nOne hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.\n“Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,” says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit.\nSinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.\n“That was a great email to receive,” says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school. “I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,” she says.\nSinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions. \n“If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,” says Sinzinkayo. “I would like to complete a PhD.”\n“Psychology is a good foundational education. As a ‘plan B’ I would want to go into marketing.”\nSinzinkayo expects to finish her bachelor’s degree by 2018.\n#CUgiving\nRead more inspiring stories like this one in Momentum, Concordia's Donor and Student Awards newsletter.\nRelated links\n"}

At what age can children explain people’s behaviours as being guided by their mental states? Who do toddlers trust to teach them new things — and why?\nThese questions, and others like it, have been the focus of Diane Poulin-Dubois ’s research for the last 31 years at Concordia. The psychology professor from the Faculty of Arts and Science leads the Cognitive and Language Development Lab .\nOn October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award — the Prix Acfas Thérèse Gouin-Décarie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.\n“Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois’s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.\n“We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois’s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l’ACFAS (faculty award). She was also on the organizing committee when Concordia hosted the 2014 Acfas conference , “Research: Zones of Creativity and Convergence, ” welcoming 5,100 scholars and offering 173 colloquia.\nPrevious Acfas winners from the Concordia community include Michel Laroche , John Molson School of Business marketing professor, André Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, Sherry Simon , French professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science, Marguerite Mendell , professor and graduate program director for the School of Community and Public Affairs, and François-Marc Gagnon , founding director of the Gail and Stephen A.

She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.”\nThis career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.\n“We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.” Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example, “dog/chien”) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation.\nHer other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called “trust,” which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.\n“We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,” says Poulin-Dubois.\n“My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to? Then you can speculate how our species has evolved differently or similarly to others.”\nPraise from the department\nWilliam Bukowski , psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Centre for Research in Human Development , is thrilled that Acfas is recognizing Poulin-Dubois.\n“Diane has been at the forefront of understanding how the concepts that were popular in a Piagetian perspective can now be applied to other domains of functioning, such as bilingualism,” he says. \n“She is remarkable in her capacity to develop rigorous and very creative laboratory tests.”\nBukowski also points to Poulin-Dubois’s success as a supervisor.\nTwo of her graduate students, Cristina Crivello and Sabrina Chiarella, have won Graduate Research Communicator of the Year Awards for their papers on the benefits of bilingualism and early trust. “When your students win awards, it reflects well on everyone.

The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world.\nToday, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career.\nI grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education.\nWhen applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be “a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.”\nI had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade.\nThis allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students’ results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents.\nI have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died.\nMy hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.  \nOn Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution.\nThe government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years.\nI have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture “of the moment.” We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face.\nThe main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum — I am referring to those who did not participate.\nBut in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.\n \nFind out more about Concordia's Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it’s good for mind and body.\nIn fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood — but in markedly different ways.\nThe researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.\n“We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,” says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study’s lead author.\nIn particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain’s two hemispheres — in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.\n“This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,” Giacosa explains. “Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.”\n‘This work has major potential’\nInterestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field.\nAccording to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other. “Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.”\nVirginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study’s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.\n“This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,” Penhune says. “Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.”\nSome studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.\n“Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson’s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,” says Penhune.\n*Partners in research: The co-authors of this study — Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J. Karpati, Nicholas E.V. Foster, Virginia Penhune, and principal investigator Krista L. Hyde — are all members of the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research.

In 2015–16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity .\nThe series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.\n“Last year really exceeded our expectations,” says André Roy , dean of FAS. “So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.”\nOn Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season, “ Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,” invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations.\nHeld in collaboration with Concordia’s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes .\nAccording to Roy, this year’s series won’t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A. “We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.”\nClaudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public.\nGauthier’s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age. “I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,” she explains.\n‘Thinking outside the box’\nFellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.\n“I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,” says Chapman. “I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.”\nAnother first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the “Come to your senses” event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .\n“I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,” explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .\n“I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.”\nRoy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.\n“We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats. As great as last year was, I am confident this one will be even better.”\nThe other speakers at this fall’s first Beyond Disciplines event are:\n"}

People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,” says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.*\nEvery second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year — the denouement, if you will.\nEthnodramas and 100 original songs\n“The theme of our show is 'We Can',” says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director. “The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.”\nPart of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist.\nThe CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas — plays based on the performers' lived experiences — as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.\n \nStephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience. “Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.”\nGoulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. “They always want me to come back, and I never say no.”\n‘Taking everyone for who they are’\nChoreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga .\nSanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.\n“It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,” she says. “They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.”\nFrom the stage to the big screen\nThe Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .\n“When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,” says Snow.\nBecause the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale.\nCrafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase.\nGet your tickets today for the Centre for the Arts in Human Development retrospective show, A Night at the Oscar , taking place June 17 and 18 at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall.\n*The Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health recognizes individuals or organizations for building awareness of mental health issues in the community through research, service, advocacy, combatting stigma or calling the public’s attention to the needs of family caregivers. It was presented to Stephen Snow at the Annual General Meeting of AMI-Quebec Action on Mental Illness on June 7.\nRelated Links\n"}

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.\n“Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in — even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,” says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.\n“Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.”\n \nHormones influence problem-solving\nFor the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a “hormonal profile” questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits.\nThe participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways.\nAt the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end.\nResults were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks.\nThat proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks — such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words — depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle.\nEssentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.\n“This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,” says Brake.\n“For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones”\n'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain'\nFor recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study’s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.\n“Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants — and male rats — in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,” she says.\n“I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.”\n"}

His tireless work has enabled us to recruit outstanding faculty of international quality, attract top-quality students and postdocs and emerge as an important new partner in the Quebec and Canadian landscape of health research.\n“I am proud of and grateful for everything that Louis has given to Concordia. He is a true leader. I know I am not alone in being sad at his decision to move over the mountain, but I am very eager to pursue new collaborations as he embarks on the next phase of his astonishing career.”\nFor his part, Bherer is proud of what the PERFORM research team has been able to accomplish over the last four years. “We’ve laid the foundation for our mission of advancing research, education and community engagement while offering unique opportunities for new discoveries in preventive health research,” he says.\n“With the support and guidance of the exceptional team of researchers, students and staff we have established, PERFORM will continue to blossom in the years to come.”\nLooking forward, Carr is extremely pleased that PERFORM will be in safe hands under the leadership of Habib Benali, given the scope of his international research and administrative portfolio, his extraordinary connections with the health research community in Montréal and his commitment to the institutional vision for PERFORM.\n“We are unbelievably fortunate that a person of Habib’s calibre and experience is poised to accept the interim scientific director position,” says Carr. “As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM’s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.”\nBenali’s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position.\nPrior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Université de Montréal.\nBenali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM — part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University — until 2015.\nHe looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,” he says. “I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.”\nCarr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia’s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.\n \n"}

At least one in four Canadians will have an anxiety disorder in their lifetime.\nWhile effective therapies for these often-debilitating disorders exist, many sufferers find them very difficult to engage with or complete. This prompted researchers at Concordia to look for ways to make treatment easier to handle for those who need it most.\nIn studies recently published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders and forthcoming in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Concordia psychology researchers Hannah Levy and Adam Radomsky show that the very behaviours people use to avoid anxiety could become part of an effective treatment, and that patients have a significant role to play in deciding when those behaviours are no longer necessary.\nRadomsky and Levy focus on safety behaviours — things people do to make themselves feel less anxious. Examples include wearing gloves when touching dirty objects, avoiding eye contact during stressful interactions, distracting yourself when doing something scary — any behaviour that increases feelings of safety in anxiety-provoking situations.\n“Traditionally, psychologists thought that fading out or eliminating these behaviours entirely should be the primary focus of the therapy used to combat anxiety disorders. But we found that changing those behaviours and giving patients greater agency is much more effective,” says Radomsky, professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology and senior author of the studies.\nHe and Levy followed 157 study participants — ranging from people with low-level anxieties to those diagnosed OCD — as they adapted old habits with new ones that they could use to avoid anxiety during exposure therapy, in which the therapist exposes the patient to feared objects or situations without any danger.\nThe researchers found that using new safety behaviours during exposure therapy was slightly more helpful to participants than their usual or typical safety behaviours.\nThey also found that the most important aspect of reducing the use of safety behaviours in therapy is that the client or patient be the one who decides when they are ready to move forward without them. \n“This is different from the standard approach in which therapists encourage people to drop their safety behaviours at the outset of the therapy, which often leads people to drop out or refuse the treatment. Under the right conditions, safety behaviours have the potential to make the therapy more effective, and more acceptable,” explains Levy, who recently defended her PhD in psychology at Concordia and will graduate this summer.\nRadomsky, who also holds a Concordia University Research Chair in Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the results of the research could help therapists shape their approach to best help each person with whom they’re working.\n“It’s our hope that these findings will help to reduce the number of people who refuse or drop out of cognitive behavioural therapies and should result in more people getting the help that they need.”\nPartners in research: These studies were supported in part by the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\nFind out more about clinical and health research in the Concordia Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

This year’s theme is “Bioimaging for Prevention and Health Research,” and will include presentations on brain imaging, body composition, medical and musculoskeletal imaging.\nWhy bioimaging?\n“The timing is right for this topic because of significant developments at PERFORM this year,” says  Karen Li , chair of the PERFORM Centre’s Scientific Events and Communications Committee and a professor in the Department of Psychology .\n“Our imaging suite recently opened, and we recently welcomed Habib Benali, PERFORM’s new associate scientific director of biomedical engineering. It’s quite a coup for Concordia to have Professor Benali here given his international reputation.”\nAt the conference, Benali and PERFORM research member Jean-Paul Soucy will be showcasing current imaging projects led by PERFORM members.\nThe conference's international list of guest speakers  includes: Pedro Antonio Valdes-Sosa from Cuba, Kirsi A. Virtanen from Finland, Alan Evans from Montreal, Julie Hides from Australia, Timothy J. Hall and Shen from the USA.\n“Their lectures will cover a wide range of subjects because bioimaging has such a diverse application. We have someone talking about elite athletes and astronauts, someone talking about neuro-degeneration and another talking about image-based biomarkers,” says Li.\nBioimaging and obesity research\nBioimaging is a relevant public health topic, Li says, “because it helps with early diagnosis.”\nWhich brings us back to Shen’s research on obesity.\n“Recent advances in MRI and MRS made it possible to quantify total body and regional fat, to map fat tissue distribution and to evaluate fat in places like the liver and pancreas,” she explains.\n“The digitalization and centralization of these images allowed for clarifying obesity-related questions in various diseases. Imaging offers enormous opportunities in obesity care and prevention in diseases.”\nNew methodology workshop\nOn Friday, May 20, the day after the bioimaging conference, the PERFORM Centre will host its first Methodological Workshop in Imaging at Concordia’s Loyola Campus, with a theme of “Longitudinal Analysis with Neuroimaging Data.”\nThe workshop provides an opportunity to learn new methods special to longitudinal neuroimaging studies. There will be a series of five talks from experts who will introduce longitudinal studies involving different neuroimaging modalities (MRI, fMRI, PET, EEG), while focusing on specific methods to analyse that data.\nGood prognosis\nTo date, more than 200 people are registered to attend the annual conference and learn more about how bioimaging can serve preventive healthcare.\nWill they be comparing their BMIs? Not likely.\nThe third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference begins at 7:45 a.m. on Thursday, May 19. The Methodological Workshop in Imaging begins at 9 a.m. on Friday, May 20.\nOnline registration for both events is closed, but it is still possible to register on site.\n \n"}

She currently writes A Concordian abroad , a column about her term at the Danish School of Media and Journalism.\nTomorrow is Friday the 13th, commonly accepted as the unluckiest day of the year for anyone who isn’t a serial killer .\nWhile many scoff at the superstitious occasion, some 17 to 21 million people in the United States reportedly suffer from \"friggatriskaidekaphobia,\"  the clinical term for being spooked by this most freaky of Fridays.\nWhy are we afraid?\nIn 2004, the North Carolina Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute estimated the United States loses $800 to 900 million in business on Fridays that coincide with the 13th day of the month, as superstitious consumers are too terrified to go about their daily lives.\n“You just need enough people talking about something in a scary enough way to then become apprehensive about it yourself,” says Adam Radomsky , a professor of psychology at Concordia . “Once that happens it’s very easy not only to worry, but also to tie all minor negative events that could happen at any given time to the superstition.”\nValérie De Courville Nicol , a professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology , says society’s need for control and catharsis is part of Friday the 13th.\n“I think that in contemporary culture we have a particularly strong fear of anything that is uncertain, uncontrollable and unpredictable,” she says.\n“We live in a control-oriented culture, so we don't have much tolerance for irrational phenomena. It's almost as if this day is a culturally legitimate day during which people can express the feelings they can't let themselves express normally. It’s a ritualized relationship that has a function in allowing people to put their fears somewhere.”\nBut De Courville Nicol believes that being afraid is not always a bad thing.\n“You can understand it from a psychological perspective as an irrational fear, but many of the fears that we share in common as a group help produce our identity and our feeling of belonging.” \nThe origin of Friday the 13th\nFolklorists aren’t exactly sure where the most feared date in history comes from . No written evidence for the superstition exists prior to the 19th century.\nThe working theory is that Friday the 13 is actually the product of two separate fears working in tandem. The first is the fear of the number 13 , and the second is the Christian-rooted superstition that Fridays are unlucky, stemming from the belief that it was the day of Crucifixion.\nAs far as the number 13 goes, people have seemingly always been wary of it. Even the Babylonians omitted it from their Code of Hammurabi . Numerologists suspect this could be because it is an outlier of the number 12, thought to be the representation of completeness and perfection.\nThink about it: 12 apostles of Christ, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 gods of Olympus, 12 zodiac signs, 12 months in a year, 12 hours on the clock.\nThe number has also been spoiling dinner parties for the last few millennia. It is believed that if 13 people dine together, at least one will die within the year. This harkens back to biblical times, as Judas was the 13th person to sit at Christ’s table for the last supper — and we all know how that turned out.\nFun fact: in the 1880s a society, dubbed the Thirteen Club , was formed to dispel the aforementioned superstition. Members threw 13-people dinner parties on the 13th of every month, and liked to walk under ladders.\nFive U.S. presidents were honorary members: Chester Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

For example, when a transplant recipient thinks they inherited traits of the donor.\n“People the world over are essentialist thinkers,” he said. “They are attracted to the idea that hidden essences make things as they are. And because genetic concepts remind people of essences, they tend to think of genes in ways similar to essences. That is, people tend to think about genetic causes as immutable, deterministic, homogenous, discrete and natural.”\nHeine went on to examine how essentialist biases lead people to think differently about sex, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), crime, eugenics and disease whenever these are described in genetic terms.\n“Our essentialist biases make people vulnerable to the sensationalist hype that has emerged with the genomic revolution and access to direct-to-consumer genotyping services,” concluded Heine, who recommends more genetic education for the general public to reduce essentialist thinking and counteract the idea that genetic causes are inevitable.\nFind out more about the  Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

Just like Pavlov’s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink.\nIndeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .\n“Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,” says Nadia Chaudhri , the study’s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .\n“Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.”\nThe results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them.\nAccording to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn’t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.\n“Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,” Chaudhri explains.\n“These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.”\nFor the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol — the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks.\nThe researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue.\nThis happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered.\nThe researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable.\nSo how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?\n“Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,” says Chaudhri. “By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.”\nShe explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.\n“This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,” says Chaudhri.\n“Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.”\nChaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.\nRead the cited study here , led by Nadia Chaudhri, professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology . \n \n"}

Ryder\nIs Denmark the happiest country in the world? | Photo by Giuseppe Milo (Flickr CC)\nAccording to the 2016 World Happiness Report , Denmark is (once again) the happiest country in the world, and thus we should study their society closely to see what they're doing right ... But is it that simple?\nHere, Andrew G. Ryder , associate professor and director of clinical training in Concordia’s Department of Psychology , evaluates the methodology behind the fourth edition of the global survey and shines a light on how metrics and indices are at play:\nFor millennia, philosophers, theologians and many others have argued about what constitutes the “good life.”\nWhile some thinkers have emphasized objective markers, particularly economic indicators, others have advocated a broader view that encompasses personal and/or collective well-being. Aristotle’s eudaimonia is not merely happiness as maximizing positive emotions, but encompasses wisdom, personal virtue and so on. Social scientists have joined the fray in recent decades.\nBeyond the GDP\nThe rankings, and the accompanying report, have several advantages. First, the coverage of the study is impressive, and considers most countries in the world — ranging from Denmark (top rank) to Burundi (bottom rank).\nSecond, the resulting index and rankings help move the debate beyond economic indicators. This encourages societies to evaluate policies in terms of their impact on the well-being of their citizens, not merely on whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increased.\nOf course, it may well be good to increase GDP, but we could then judge the benefits of such an increase in terms of their impact on human-centred goals, rather than treating economy-centred goals as ends in themselves.\nThird, the approach taken in this survey was to ask respondents to rank their relative position on a 10-rung ladder from “the best possible life for you” down to “the worst possible life for you.” This method is a marked improvement from older cross-national surveys that used rating scales to measure “happiness” levels.\nFourth, the end results are easy to understand, communicate and discuss, helping to fuel a debate about what really matters both within and across different societies.\nAssumptions behind the numbers \nMy major concern with these kinds of studies — with the straightforward presentation of national \"league tables\" and their seeming ease of interpretation — is that there are a lot of assumptions buried in these numbers. The authors themselves do an admirable job of covering many concerns, exceptions, interpretive challenges and so on in their report — but the number of people who will read the report will surely be dwarfed by the number of people who read the news coverage and quickly look up their own country’s standing.\nBut is happiness actually the end goal against which we would want to evaluate all other goals? What if certain kinds of wisdom make us less happy, but better in other ways? What if happiness within a country is boosted at the expense of happiness in a neighbouring country, or if present happiness is being boosted at the expense of future generations?\nComplicating matters further, it’s not entirely clear that happiness is the best word to use. Unlike many previous studies, the word happiness is not actually used in the main task, which assesses self-perceived quality of life.\nThis approach represents a methodological advance in many ways, but it does complicate the interpretation: the jump to happiness, to the high arousal positive emotional state signified by the English word “happiness” is not straightforward.\nCross-national comparisons\nThese kinds of problems are inevitably compounded by cross-national comparisons, especially when people shaped by different cultural contexts respond to the task in different ways. For example, is it possible to raise people’s self-perceived quality of life by lowering expectations, so that one’s vision of “the best possible life for you” is constrained?\nIn my field of cultural psychology, we have learned that cross-national comparisons are hampered by the \"reference group effect\" where people in different cultural contexts respond to rating scales by comparing themselves with their perception of average people living in their own local environment.\nCultural psychologists have also found that people in different cultural contexts vary in terms of which emotional states are most desirable in the first place: whereas many Americans place a premium on “the pursuit of happiness,” many people living in East Asian societies show a marked preference for low arousal positive emotions such as “tranquility.” There is even evidence from Russia showing that people can even value negative emotions as more useful, as more authentic, as part of a richly lived life.\nBeware of national stereotypes about emotions\nAnother problem with these sorts of cross-national analyses is that subgroup differences are masked. I can just about believe a single score to represent Luxembourg, but what does a single score for China or India even mean? Should we really average Tibet’s happiness into China’s overall score? These are vast countries with considerable regional diversity, not to mention ethnic, religious, urban-rural and many other important distinctions.\nTo be fair, the authors are admirably clear about this issue, noting that there are wide discrepancies across various groups within each country. But the average reader is likely to miss these points and focus instead on the rankings.\nWe are then a short distance from aggregate “happiness” scores to national stereotypes about emotions. A conclusion such as: “Denmark’s sociocultural, political, and economic situation has helped it to become a country where many people rate themselves as at or close to the best life they can imagine for themselves,” becomes: “Danes are the happiest people in the world!”\nAlternate indices, different results \nSo I am pleased to see that this ambitious study is helping to move the discussion about national priorities beyond GDP, but hope the discussion continues to move beyond happiness rankings.\nRemember, we could change the survey question to reflect a different view of happiness, or change the criteria to yield different rankings. We could decide that societies should be judged on the happiness of the poorest 10 per cent, or the happiness of the most disadvantaged demographic subgroup or the ratio of happiness to environmental footprint, etc.\nThere are numerous alternative indices that could help get us beyond GDP, each one with particular assumptions, and each one of which would yield somewhat different results.\n \n"}

Their parents consistently report greater stress levels, caregiving burden and depression than parents of typically developing children.\nChronic caregiving stress has also been associated with poorer physical health — more pain, more disruptions from physical-health problems and lower overall health-related quality of life.\nOne powerful way to reduce their stress: social support. That’s according to a new study published in Family Relations by researchers from Concordia.\nAnd that support is essential as children — and their parents — age. It could also have important consequences for health costs.\nFor the study, psychology professors Jean-Philippe Gouin and Erin T. Barker , as well as their co-authors, investigated whether social support can protect against stress-induced immune problems.\nThey asked 56 healthy parents of children with ASD to complete questionnaires on formal social support (provided by health or social services professionals), informal social support (provided by significant others, friends and family) as well as self-rated health and recent somatic symptoms.\nStudy participants also provided blood samples to check for inflammation — the automatic reaction of the innate immune system upon exposure to infection, injury or abnormal cells, or psychological stress. Chronic low-grade inflammation is also associated with greater risk for several age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, frailty, dementia and early mortality.\nThe results indicated that greater informal social support was associated with lower inflammation, and that a higher number of formal support services received by the family was related to better self-rated health and lower inflammation.\nNotably, the impact of support services on the parents’ inflammation levels increased with the age of the affected child.\n“The impact of chronic caregiving stress on health likely becomes more pronounced as the parents are aging and their immune system responds less efficiently to challenges,” says Gouin. “The need for formal and informal support thus remains high even as the child with ASD is becoming an adult.”\nHe adds that the study results emphasize the need for continued services for these families, who are experiencing lifelong parenting challenges.\n“Given the reciprocal relationship between child and parental health and well-being, supporting the parents in coping with chronic caregiving stress might not only improve the child’s outcome, but also may help maintain an optimal family environment for a longer period of time. Supporting the parents in providing care to their children with ASD might then represent a cost-effective strategy in the long-term.” \nGouin is now continuing this research by following families during their ASD-affected children’s last years of high school and the first few years after graduation to examine the impact of social support services on parental health.\nCurrently, 120 families are participating, but Gouin hopes to recruit 100 more in the next two years. Interested individuals should contact the study research coordinator at Parents.FWB@concordia.ca or visit their website .\nPartners in research: This study was partly funded by Concordia University, the Canada Research Chairs program and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.\n \nRead the cited study , led by Concordia’s Jean-Philippe Gouin.\n \n"}

But are there hidden benefits to being bilingual? Research from Concordia reveals a new perk visible in the problem-solving skills of toddlers.\nThe results of a study recently published by the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology show that bilingual children are better than monolinguals at a certain type of mental control, and that those children with more practice switching between languages have even greater skills.\nBilingual speakers can thank the sometimes-arduous practice of switching from one language to another for this skill. “This switching becomes more frequent as children grow older and as their vocabulary size increases,” says Diane Poulin-Dubois, a professor in Concordia’s Department of Psychology and the study’s senior author.\n“Therefore, the superior performance on these conflict tasks appears to be due to bilinguals’ strengthened cognitive flexibility and selective attention abilities as they have increased experience in switching across languages in expressive vocabulary.”\nPoulin-Dubois and Cristina Crivello, a graduate student with Concordia’s Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH), led a group of researchers* in a longitudinal investigation, which compared bilingual toddlers to their monolingual peers, tracking the tots as they gained greater vocabularies in each of their two languages.\nFor the study, the researchers assessed the vocabularies of 39 bilingual children and 43 monolinguals when they were aged 24 months, and then again at 31 months. During the second assessment, the researchers also had the young participants perform a battery of tasks to test their cognitive flexibility and memory skills.\n“For the most part, there was no difference between the bilingual and monolingual toddlers,” says Poulin-Dubois, who is also a member of CRDH. “But that changed dramatically when it came to the conflict inhibition test, and the differences were especially apparent in the bilingual toddlers whose vocabulary had increased most.”\nIn this case, conflict inhibition refers to the mental process of overriding a well learned rule that you would normally pay attention to.\nTo assess toddlers’ abilities in this domain, Crivello, who undertook the research as part of her master’s thesis and is the first author of the study, administered two tests:\nReverse categorization — participants were told to put a set of little blocks into a little bucket and big blocks into a big bucket. Then the instructions were switched — big blocks in the little bucket and little blocks in the big bucket.\nShape conflict — participants were shown pictures of different sized fruit and asked to name them. Then a new series of images was shown, with a small fruit embedded inside a large one. Toddlers were asked to point to the little fruit.\nIt wasn’t surprising to the researchers that the bilingual children performed significantly better on the conflict inhibition tasks than did their monolingual counterparts.\n“Language switching underlies the bilingual advantage on conflict tasks,” says Crivello. “In conflict inhibition, the child has to ignore certain information — the size of a block relative to a bucket, or the fact that one fruit is inside another. That mirrors the experience of having to switch between languages, using a second language even though the word from a first language might be more easily accessible.”\nThe unique feature of the study was the finding that the more language switching toddlers engaged in, the more it benefitted them. Within the bilingual group of toddlers, those who had amassed a greater number of “doublets” — pairs of words in each language, such as dog/chien — performed even better on the conflict inhibition tasks.\n“By the end of the third year of life, the average bilingual child uses two words for most concepts in his or her vocabulary, so young bilingual children gradually acquire more experience in switching between languages,” says Poulin-Dubois.\n*Partners in research: This research was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

The challenge for Booij is to better understand how stresses during pregnancy and in the first years of life may lead to unwelcome changes via serotonin and other neurotransmitters.\n“We know from animal work that environmental factors can influence your neurochemicals, in utero and in childhood,\" Booij says.\nIt is important to note that external stresses \"don't mean a person is stuck for life,” she adds. “There are many ways to compensate — you're not doomed to depression for example.\"\nConsequences may be modified, if not reversed, by, for instance, sound parenting, she says. A positive and enriching environment for an infant may help to compensate for perinatal stresses and early childhood adversity to the brain's development.\n\"We would expect from animal work that brain plasticity can take place: the brain is prone to change by environmental factors,” Booij says. “There is some evidence that some damage can be compensated for.\"\nShe's studying the genes that regulate serotonin, but also those linked to other neurotransmitters, as well as to hormones and biochemicals that affect human brain development and behaviour.\nHer work involves neuro-imaging, and PERFORM, on the Loyola Campus, has equipment for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning.\n\"With this equipment we can look at the structure of the brain and how it responds to certain stimuli, and look at specific neurotransmitters.\"\nIt's a complicated and important field. \"In the long term my research, a better understanding of early brain development, might help develop treatment, prevention and intervention programs for at-risk populations.\"\nFind out more about research at the PERFORM Centre .\n \n"}

Concordia Vanier scholar Poppy Wilkinson investigates\nThe PhD researcher examines narcissism in early adolescence\nPosted on December 16, 2015\n|\nSource: University Communications Services\nWhat is the “healthy self” in early adolescents? That’s the fundamental question behind Poppy Wilkinson's proposal to the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships program .\nPoppy Wilkinson: “My interests have always been about people –– how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world.”\nWilkinson, a Concordia MA and first-year PhD student in the university's  Department of Psychology , now has the financial support to focus on finding the answer.\nShe landed the research scholarship in 2014 and, after a brief deferral, is now  joining Concordia's three 2015 Vanier recipients .\nThe Government of Canada launched the Vanier program in 2008 to strengthen the country’s ability to attract and retain world-class doctoral students, and establish Canada as a global centre of excellence in research and higher learning. \nAnnually, 167 Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships are awarded to national and international students. Winners receive $50,000 each, for three years.\nNarcissism, interrupted\nThe official title of Wilkinson's project is “The Social Consequences of Self-Distortions During Early Adolescence: A Cross-Cultural Perspective.”\n“I’ll be studying the social functioning of early adolescents who see themselves more positively than is objectively warranted,” she says. “This kind of distortion in self-concept is known as narcissism.”\nShe clarifies that she isn’t studying the narcissistic personality disorder found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n“I’m looking at what they call 'childhood normal narcissism.' While in the past, narcissism has been considered a disorder, recently it has also come to be understood as a normal-range individual difference.”\nNarcissism is characterized by a self-view that is at once grandiose and fragile, as it is highly contingent on the validation of others. It is associated with a host of negative behaviours including impulsivity, aggression, increased risk taking and exploitation, as well as unstable interpersonal relationships.\n“Surprisingly little is known about how narcissism functions in adulthood or childhood, particularly with respect to social experiences and peer groups,” adds Wilkinson.\n“In the literature, narcissism is usually assessed with self-report measures, but because narcissism plays out in the social realm, the perspective of peers is also important and interesting.”\n3 research goals\nWilkinson's research comprises a three-part project concerning the social consequences of childhood normal narcissism in 10-to-12-year-olds in Canada, the Netherlands and Colombia.\nShe’ll be working out of the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory , which is also known as the Bukowski Lab, in reference to William Bukowski , a psychology professor at Concordia. It’s part of the Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH) .\nWilkinson’s three research goals are:\n1. To clarify the association between narcissism, social validation and aggression\n2. To better understand the social status of children high in narcissism\n3. To explore cultural variations in adolescents' self-concept, and how these children function in their diverse social worlds\n“The results could lead to practical implications for educational settings,” says Wilkinson. “Some children benefit from initiatives aimed to boost self-esteem, but other children who feel superior may benefit from a different kind of intervention.”\nFrom English lit to psychology\nHow did Wilkinson go from a BA in English literature to pursuing her PhD in psychology?\n“My interests have always been about people –– how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world, why they do the things they do and what consequences this has for them and for those around them,” she says.\n“Analyzing the complex patterns and themes of human behavior is what attracted me to earn a bachelor’s degree in English literature with a minor in socio-cultural anthropology. Indeed, a key element of any good story lies in how an individual’s life history intersects with his or her social and cultural context.”\nIt is these same core interests that drew Wilkinson to research peer relations in developmental psychology and, more specifically, cross-cultural individual differences in self-concept.\n"}

What better time to celebrate Concordians working in the field of sleep research?\nLooking at everyone from children to the elderly, Concordia’s researchers are studying the patterns, influences and consequences of sleep.\nJennifer McGrath: stress and sleep\n“My research focuses on how sleep impacts heart health and obesity in children — specifically, why poor families have poor health,” says Jennifer McGrath , associate professor in the Department of Psychology and Concordia’s inaugural PERFORM Chair in Childhood Preventive Health and Data Science. \"The stress of being poor gets under their skin, literally, and stress seems to make its biggest impact while we're sleeping.\"\nHere, at the 2015 Chancellor’s Builders Dinner, McGrath’s discusses how sleep is critical for good health:\n&amp;nbsp;\nA new study from September 2015, led by researchers Jinshia Ly, McGrath and Jean-Philippe Gouin from Concordia’s Centre for Clinical Research in Health (CCRH) and the PERFORM Centre , shows that poor sleep might explain how stress impacts health in kids.\n“Getting a good night’s sleep might buffer the impact of stress on kids’ cortisol level, which is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland to regulate the body’s cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems,” says McGrath, also the director of Concordia’s Pediatric Public Health Psychology (PPHP) Laboratory . “Long-term exposure to cortisol can put people at risk for health problems, like heart diseases, weight gain and depression.”\nThis study was part of the larger, ongoing Healthy Heart Project directed by McGrath. It was made possible by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Operating Grant awarded to McGrath and the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé bourse de formation maîtrise awarded to Ly. The CIHR funding was renewed and the project is funded until 2020.\nThanh Dang-Vu: ageing and sleep\nWhat is the relationship between sleep and cognition in older adults?\nNeurologist Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor in the Department of Exercise Science, is currently recruiting people over the age of 65 for a sleep study to get some answers. \nThanh Dang-Vu: “Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases.”\n“Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases,” says Dang-Vu, Concordia Research Chair in Sleep, Neuroimaging and Cognitive Health at Concordia’s Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology and the PERFORM Centre, is also a medical doctor at the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal .\n“In the general population, chronic insomnia, which is insomnia for more than three months, is about 10 to 15 per cent. In the elderly, people older than 65, insomnia rates can be between 30 and 34 per cent, or one third of the population — at least double that of younger people,” he says. \nThat's a problem, Dang-Vu explains, because the population is more fragile. Insomniacs have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Too often, insomnia is treated with sleeping pills and patients become dependent.\nCognition concerns\n“We’ve recruited 20 participants over 65 years of age who take benzodiazepines — like Ativan, Klonopin and Serax, for example — to spend the night at our sleep lab,” says Dang-Vu, who won the 2015 Roger Broughton Young Investigator Award from the  Canadian Sleep Society  in recognition of his significant early career contributions to the field of sleep research in Canada.\n“We’re offering them a treatment called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),” says Dang-Vu, who wants to see if CBTI will improve their cognition.\n“If that's the case, it would emphasize the importance of treating insomnia for maintaining good cognitive function with age,” he says. “With age, we have a larger risk of developing memory problems. Sleep might be one of these aspects that help prevent the development of dementia. It’s important to look at that.”\nThe study is funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé and the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal.\nFor more information about Thanh Dang-Vu’s sleep lab, visit the Facebook page.\nTo participate in Dang-Vu’s sleep study, contact study coordinator Caroline Desrosiers at 514-340-3540, ext. 4790, or email caroline.desrosiers@criugm.qc.ca .\n \n"}

Her lab — which studies fear, reward and memory — is a Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) project with a total value of approximately $375,000 (including cash contributions from Québec's Ministère de l'Éducation et de l'Enseignement supérieur and from Concordia, and in-kind contributions from equipment suppliers).\nWhat is the goal of your research?\nMihaela Iordanova: The research in my lab focuses on understanding the behavioural and neural mechanisms that guide learning about the world around us. We seek to understand what neural circuits are involved in how we come to expect rewarding or fearful events, as well as how we update these expectations in our dynamic environments.\nUpdated memories can be fickle and subject to disruption, so we aim to develop ways to strengthen such recent memories. Sometimes, the stimuli that we base our expectations on are complex mnemonic events, which combine cues from diverse modalities such as a particular place or time. Our work also seeks to understand the nature of such complex memories.\nWhat do you hope will be the impact on society and your field of study?\nMI: Our work examines both fear and reward, and we hope to integrate and better understand the interaction between these opposing motivational states.\nWe seek to uncover which circuits, as opposed to individual brain areas, process reward and fear, as well as provide a novel understanding of their interaction behaviourally and neutrally, something that has remained largely elusive but has attracted much interest in recent times.\nIndeed, exaggeration in the processing of rewarding events translates to similar exaggerated processing of aversive events, and this has been linked to addiction.\nThe paradigms we use in our work represent animal models of psychopathologies such as addiction, obesity and anxiety. Examining the integration of fear and reward will provide a novel take on the psychological and neural mechanisms of these conditions. Ultimately, we hope to establish behavioural paradigms, which can inform and lead to the development of novel treatments for addiction, obesity and anxiety.\nNow that you've won a Canada Research Chair (CRC), what next steps do you hope to take? \nMI: The CRC will allow the lab to continue our research on fear and reward, but will also provide us with a way to delve into these questions using advanced optogenetic, pharamacogenetic and real-time neural recording techniques.\nThis provides a means to elucidate the neural mechanisms of reward and fear from the cell to the circuit level. Our lab will push the boundaries of the neurobiology of fear and reward expectation, as well as memory formation by integrating theoretical stipulations of learning with neural techniques that prod brain function in real time and examine how alterations in brain function influence information processing.\nFind out more about the Department of Psychology .\n \n"}

In Canada, that’s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky.\nEnter the iPad: a technological device that’s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and — according to new research from Concordia  — is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices.\nA study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment.\nAnd that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled.\nFor the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading.\nThe researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants’ visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.\n“Unsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,” says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia’s Department of Psychology and the study’s first author.\n“What was interesting to note was that it didn’t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),” he says.\n“When we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.”\nAnother benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.\n“Tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,” says Aaron Johnson , the study’s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR). \n“What’s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls — and they cost less than the traditional devices,” he says. “This cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.”\nPartners in research: This work was supported in part by the Vision Health Research Network, the Fonds de recherche du Québéc - Santé, the Antoine Turmel Foundation, CRIR, and the MAB-Mackay Foundation.

Après plusieurs années à suivre les traces des premiers explorateurs vikings qui ont foulé le sol du Nouveau Monde, l’artiste s’est rendue au Groenland pour rejoindre une équipe d’archéologues danois œuvrant à la restauration des ruines des colonies nordiques les mieux préservées du monde. Dans ce paysage à mi-chemin entre l’Ancien et le Nouveau Monde, l’histoire se révèle au fil des strates qu’elle parcourt. Des pierres pouvant avoir servi de fondation dans une construction ancienne sont aujourd’hui intégrées dans les murs d’une maison moderne. D’autres pierres ainsi détournées il y a longtemps de leur fonction initiale sont récupérées pour la restauration d’un site archéologique.\nQue signifie « restaurer une ruine »?

Le jour suivant, des émeutes ont éclaté et un mouvement social est alors né : Montréal-Nord Républik. Le meurtre de Fredy Villanueva a non seulement attisé le sentiment d’exclusion sociale et le mécontentement qui sommeillaient depuis des années, mais aussi mis en lumière les tactiques de surveillance policière actuelles, l’asymétrie des pouvoirs institutionnels et le profilage racial. Montréal-Nord existe sous l’œil des autorités. Caméras de sécurité et de surveillance, télévision en circuit fermé, applications Google Maps et Google Street View usent tous d’un regard descendant jeté par divers mécanismes institutionnels asymétriques, qui façonnent des perspectives verticales composites. Ces mécanismes agissent de manière ambiguë et invisible, tout comme l’exclusion sociale coexiste avec la représentation inégale des marginalisés. Victor Arroyo a documenté les mouvements populaires de Montréal-Nord et leurs lieux de résistance à l’aide d’une caméra de sécurité, reflétant les tactiques de surveillance.

Although we often think of political discourse as rational, literary sources are crucial to democratic politics as they can offer a civic education or way for citizens to think about and understand politics and political debates. Such literary sources are also essential to democratic discourse because they provide a way to engage in politics through critique and protest.\nTargeting experts from political science, English, comparative literature, classics, history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and the liberal arts, this workshop will identify crosscutting research areas which explore the important contribution of alternative epistemological approaches to understanding, promoting, and critiquing democratic practices. Within this theme, the one-day event will investigate the state of research on literary approaches to democratic political thought and identify key areas for future research. The long-term goal will result in an edited volume on the topic.\nFaculty and PhD Students should submit short abstracts of approximately 250 words.\nDeadline for proposal submissions: OCTOBER 10, 2016\nFor more information or to submit abstracts please contact:\n"}

Image courtesy of the artists.\nEN\nDonna Akrey and Yvette Poorter are a collaborative duo that have been making/continue to make work together when they can since the 1990s (or since they jumped off a cliff into Muskoka water at age 17). Their work is multi-media and often involves easily found and/or scavenged materials. They are interested in getting lost while realizing the rarity of such a thing. So they make work to get lost in. Poorter and Akrey have been collecting stories and images from people who have a dead dad. They use these snippets of other people’s memories, as fuel to create a morphing landscape installation. Yes, the exhibition is about dads—dead dads at that—but it is also a rumination on memory and the size and viscosity of memory. A vague longing.\nExposition\nDonna Akrey et Yvette Poorter\nDu 10 avril au 19 mai 2017\nFR\nDonna Akrey et Yvette Poorter collaborent, au gré de leur disponibilité, depuis les années 1990 (ou depuis qu’elles ont sauté d’une falaise dans les eaux de Muskoka à l’âge de 17 ans). Leur œuvre multimédia fait souvent appel à des matériaux facilement trouvés ou récupérés. Bien qu’elles souhaitent pouvoir se perdre, elles réalisent la rareté d’une telle possibilité et cherchent donc plutôt à se perdre dans leurs créations. Le duo recueille des récits et des images de personnes dont le père est mort. Elles se servent de ces fragments de souvenirs d’autrui pour concevoir une installation paysagère évolutive. L’exposition traite ainsi des pères – des pères disparus, qui plus est –, mais il s’agit également d’une rumination sur la mémoire, sur sa portée et sa viscosité.
