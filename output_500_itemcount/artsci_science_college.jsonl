It also provides an opportunity for students to get together over lunch. The atmosphere is science — whether it be wrestling with a problem together, talking with a teacher, or proposing a new idea for discussion. This type of social interaction is an all-important factor in the life of scientists — who spend a lot of their career interacting with others in the field — and is the best way to gain a real understanding of scientific problems. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, to help each other, and to learn from each other. All are seen as essential ingredients of an education.\nOur  research  component is unique in Canada. Students are not just doing laboratory exercises. They are active and interested participants in the resolution of current scientific problems. This role both sharpens their understanding of science and gives them first-hand experience with what to expect from a scientific career.

These research projects allow students to acquire first-hand scientific experience. The research may be carried out with scientists at Concordia or at some other university or research institution. In recent years, students have completed projects at universities like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Rochester, Frankfurt, Freiberg, Paris, Berlin, Innsbruck, San Diego, Johns Hopkins, London University, England, Simon Fraser University, Barbados, Miami and others. The work of the student is supervised and graded either by a faculty member or by an academically qualified person at the outside institution. \nAn attractive aspect of this program is that students are expected to participate in research projects outside their field. One can find a physics student doing experiments in neurophysiology, or a biology student participating in a computer project. This program is the core of our curriculum and is unique in Canada.

She will describe in depth the physics developments that she witnessed and participated in dynamic period of its inception, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These developments led to the Standard Model of particle Physics. The Standard Model has been confirmed by experiments, culminating in the discovery of the Higgs particle physics in 2012.\nShe will give some vivid reflections on the current status of women in physics today and most importantly on the future of the field.\nThe Science College is part of Concordia University.  It offers gifted science undergraduates the opportunity to complement their regular curriculum with interdisciplinary training and early introduction to the methods of scientific research.\nOctober 20, 2016, 8 p.m. – 10 p.m.\n"}

Admission to the College is by personal interview only. In addition to their Major, members of the Science College are enrolled in a Minor in Multidisciplinary Studies in Science. Our enrolment has increased from 12 students in 1979 to the current number of 70 students. The College accepts 20 to 30 students every year.\nCriteria of eligibility\nThe criteria for eligibility necessitates that the applicant to apply to the Science College, must be enrolled in one of the Natural science programmes, namely: Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Computer Science, Exercise Science, Geography, Journalism, Physics, Psychology (B.Sc. or B.A. in Cognitive Science), and Mathematics but Actuarial Mathematics is excluded.\nThe interview\nStudents are granted an interview if the student is accepted at Concordia University. The personal interview is the key determinant for acceptance to the college. To be accepted students must possess a good academic background in natural sciences and excellent grades and complementary involvement outside the academic field.\nOther considerations\nWhen an individual applies to the college, first the grades are evaluated and a decision is made whether to grant that individual an interview. The personal interview dictates one’s acceptance to the college. Consequently, student’s exhibits exceptional motivation and aptitude but those whose performance at the interview supersede their ability to obtain excellent grades are accepted to the college. Many of these students evolve as amongst the college’s best achievers.\nWhen one applies to the Science College, one's grades are looked at and taken into account, however, large emphasis is placed on the personal interview. Hence, students who show exceptional motivation and capacity, but for some reason were not successful in obtaining the best grades can be accepted. Many of these students turn out to be among the College's high achievers.\nEach student is sent a letter after the interview and, if accepted, confirmation must be sent to the College.\nContacts\nContact us  to arrange an interview or visit Science College. \nContact us\nScience College:\n514-848-2424 ext. 2595\n"}

It was approved on April 27, 1979. To publicize the new college, the Science College  public lectures  were created, and they are still one of the major public events of the Science College.\nAs the years have passed there has been a greater demand for this type of programme and the College has grown. In 1979, there were 12 students compared to over 80 currently. But this number is still quite small and with good reason. Small numbers make for an intense learning experience where students get to know and work with each other, question the status quo, get an overview of science as a whole and participate in cutting edge research in three different areas during their tenure. The result is that Science College alumni can be found in top positions in science and medicine, both in Canada and abroad.\nContact us\nScience College:\n514-848-2424 ext. 2595\n"}

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

This includes an in depth molecular analysis of anillin, a conserved actin and myosin binding protein that is a key component of the contractile ring required for cytokinesis. A future goal will be the identification of novel  regulators of actin-myosin assembly and contraction in nonmuscle cells. This work  is being done on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and in mammalian cells.\nTeaching activities\nAdvanced Cell Biology\nSelected publications\nWernike, D., Chen, Y., Mastronardi, K., Makil, N., Piekny, A.

I regularly teach Biochemistry I (CHEM271) and Biochemistry II (CHEM375). Biochemistry I is an introductory course and covers the basics of biochemistry including enzymology, protein structure and metabolism. Biochemistry II covers more of the specific biochemical reactions involved in metabolic pathways. I also teach Discovering Biotechnology (CHEM209) which is an introduction to the world of biotechnology for non-scientists. This course covers topics such as cloning and genetic engineering and includes discussions of the societal and ethical issues that are involved. In the past few years I have also taught graduate courses in Protein Targeting and Membrane Biochemistry.\nPublications\nRecent publications\nChakraborty PK, Schmitz-Abe K, Kennedy EK, Mamady H, Naas T, Durie D, CampagnaDR, Lau A, Sendamarai AK, Wiseman DH, May A, Jolles S, Connor P, Powell C,Heeney MM, Giardina PJ, Klaassen RJ, Kannengiesser C, Thuret I, Thompson AA,Marques L, Hughes S, Bonney DK, Bottomley SS, Wynn RF, Laxer RM, Minniti CP,Moppett J, Bordon V, Geraghty M, Joyce PBM, Markianos K, Rudner AM, Holcik M,Fleming MD (2014) Mutations in TRNT1, encoding the CCA-adding enzyme, causecongenital sideroblastic anemia with B cell immunodeficiency, periodic feversand developmental delay (SIFD).

The differentiation and functional properties of smooth muscle cells depend on the cellular environment, and any disturbance of this, such as endothelial damage, inflammation or lipid retention will lead to reactions that can initiate atherosclerotic lesions. Dr Bergdahl study mechanisms involved in these processes by using state-of-the-art techniques including electrophysiology, isometric force measurements, functional proteomics, molecular genetics and advanced imaging. The overriding goal is to define conditions that are essential for the normal function and cell differentiation in the vascular wall and to translate these findings from the basic understanding and experimental animal research into clinical understanding of integrative cardiovascular control in health and disease. This is hoped to generate new therapeutic approaches which in the future might lead to better prevention of vascular disease.\nTeaching activities\n"}

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst.\nThorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes.\nWe are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions.\nThe biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution.\nWhy study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.\nRecent publications\nS.

[PubMed] [Content]\nResearch\nDrug and Alcohol Abuse, Relapse, Neuropharmacology, Pavlovian conditioning, Optogenetics\nOverview: Fundamental learning processes like Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning play a central role in the use, misuse and abuse of psychoactive substances like alcohol. In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.\nFunding: My research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Fonds de la recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQ-S), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Concordia University.\nCurrent graduate students: Franca Lacroix, Atyeh Heidari-Jam, Milan Valyear and Franz Villaruel\nResearch Assistants: Melanie Chahine, Sabrina Heffernan\nChaudhri lab, 2013\nBiography\nDr. Chaudhri earned her B.A. in Biological Foundations of Behavior with a concentration in Neuroscience at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA.

[PubMed] [Content]\nBiography\nDave Mumby received his Ph.D. in Biopsychology from the University of British Columbia in 1992. In 1994, after 18 months in a postdoctoral research position in Dr. Robert Sutherland's laboratory at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Mumby joined the Department of Psychology at Concordia University. In 1999 he joined the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology.\nFun fact\nI have chickens at home, and I'm thinking of ways to formally test their memory abilities. Seriously.\nResearch\nObject recognition, spatial memory, fear learning, context memory, neural systems\nOverview: My interests broadly include animal cognition, and the analysis and development of methods and procedures for assessing various types of memory in rodents. For example, some of our recent studies revealed concerns about the internal validity of a widely-used novel-object preference test of object-recognition memory. We are now developing a new and improved object-recognition task.\nWe also study spatial memory, fear learning, memory for contextual information, and the modulation of memory by contextual cues. We employ an array of behavioral paradigms to assess different aspects of memory, including water-maze, t-maze, radial-arm maze, and open-field tests of spatial memory, novel-object preference and delayed nonmatching-to-sample tests of object recognition, shock-probe fear learning, predator avoidance, and social transmission of food preferences.\nAdditional interests include the anatomy of memory systems underlying object-recognition and spatial memory. We occasionally conduct studies to assess these abilities in rats with surgical lesions of specific brain areas. Past studies have focused mainly on hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, amygdala, intralaminar and midline thalamus.\nTo develop their reputations as independent researchers, my graduate students are encouraged to pursue lines of inquiry they can call their own. The main requirements for a suitable research plan are: 1) the questions must be timely and important to behavioural neuroscientists, 2) we must have the financial and physical resources to conduct the research, and 3) we must have expertise with the required behavioural tests. Recent Ph.D. students did dissertation research on a rat model of schizophrenia, and the modulatory effects of estrogen on object-recognition memory.\nFunding\nMy research is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).\nLab members\nAn up-to-date list of lab members can be found at my lab website.\nBack to top\n"}

Following postdoctoral training in molecular biology and behavior with Dr. Donald Pfaff at the Rockefeller University (1990-1992), he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University where he is a full professor. Jim was the 1995 recipient of the Frank A. Beach Award from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, and in 1997 was inducted into the International Academy of Sex Research. He received the Frank A. Beach Comparative Psychology Award from the American Psychological Association in 2009, the Sandra Lieblum Lectureship from the International Society for Sexual Medicine in 2011, the Herbert Thomas Award from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2012, the Concordia University Research Award in 2013, and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality in 2014. He was made a fellow (IF) of the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and a Concordia Research Fellow, both in 2013.  Jim serves on the Standards Committee of the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM), on the Board of Directors of ISSWSH, and is the current President-Elect of the International Academy of Sex Research (IASR). Jim is an associate editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine and Sexual Medicine Reviews, section editor for preclinical research and psychophysiology for Current Sexual Health Reports, and serves on the editorial boards of the Behavioral Neuroscience, Hormones and Behavior, and Physiology and Behavior.

They see the title and they share it. Fake news is often user-generated .”\n \nNoé Sainderichin discusses fake news with his peers in the print lab.\nMatthew Gilmour, another graduate diploma student, says the issue is exacerbated by the echo chamber created by Facebook’s algorithm . \n“They will show you what you want to read and your confirmation bias will make you believe it.” \nBut a gullible general public may be just as much to blame says Gilmour’s classmate, Emilee Gilpin . “People think that if it’s there, and you hear or read it, then it’s legitimate.”\nBetween the algorithms and the advertising economy, this issue has broad implications. \n“Fake news has nothing to do with journalism,” says Donna Nebenzahl , a part-time journalism professor at Concordia and a regular contributor to the Montreal Gazette. She's concerned about technology's transformative power.\n“This is really about technology, because without it people would know where the material is coming from,” she says. “Maybe the whole thing has run away from us, and the tail is wagging the dog now.” \nIt certainly seemed that way in the US elections, which were at the centre of the most recent fake news media storm . \n“Regardless of what side you’re on, it’s not a good thing,” Gabrial says.\n \nEmilee Gilpin\nBut combatting fake news is easier said than done, says Stephane Lavoie, a visual journalism graduate diploma student. \n“It’s one of those really difficult issues that requires you to find the right balance between a certain degree of censorship and a certain degree of control.”\nIf journalists truly want to tackle this issue, Gilmour says, “we’re going to have to change the way we do things. People just don’t want mainstream media anymore.”\nNebenzahl agrees that journalists are facing an uphill struggle. “We have to get serious and we have to understand what it is we’re doing here.”\nConcordia students and teachers alike agree that, in a shrinking media marketplace , journalists are under more pressure than ever to be thorough, skeptical and hard-working in their pursuit of ‘real news’ and the ongoing battle for the public’s trust.\nMegan Perra is a journalism student in Concordia’s graduate diploma program.\n"}

But for most university students, the coming weeks mean final exams , mounting stress and negative moods .\nWhile that doesn’t seem like an ideal combination for great grades, new Concordia research shows that the occasional bout of bad feelings can actually improve students’ academic success.\nA study published in Developmental Psychology by Erin Barker , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science , shows that students who were mostly happy during their four years of university but who also experienced occasional negative moods had the highest GPAs at the time of graduation.\nIn contrast, the study also confirmed that students who experienced high levels of negative moods and low levels of positive moods often ended up with the lowest GPAs — a pattern consistent with depressive disorders.\n“Students often report feeling overwhelmed and experiencing high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms,” says Barker, who is also a member of the Centre for Research in Human Development .\n“This study shows that we need to teach them strategies to both manage negative emotions and stress in productive ways, and to maintain positive emotional experiences.”\nFor the study, Barker and her co-authors* worked with 187 first-year students at a large university. The researchers tracked the students throughout their four years of schooling by having them complete questionnaires about recent emotional experiences each year, beginning in the first year and continuing throughout their undergraduate degree.\n \nNegative emotions signal a challenge\n“We looked at students’ response patterns to better understand how experiences of positive and negative emotions occurred over time. We then combined average patterns to look how each person varied from their own average and examined different combinations of trait and state affects together,” Barker explains.\n“This allowed us to identify the pattern associated with the greatest academic success: those who were happy for the most part, but who also showed bouts of elevated negative moods.”\nThese findings demonstrate that both negative and positive emotions play a role in our successes.\n“We often think that feeling bad is bad for us. But if you're generally a happy person, negative emotions can be motivating. They can signal to you that there is a challenge that you need to face. Happy people usually have coping resources and support that they draw on to meet that challenge.”\nIn January, Barker and psychology graduate students Sarah Newcomb-Anjo and Kate Mulvihill will expand on this research by launching a new study focused on life beyond graduation. Their plan: examine patterns of emotional experience and well-being as former students navigate new challenges associated with finding work or entering a post-graduation program.\n*Partners in research: This study was co-authored by Carsten Wrosch , professor of psychology in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, Andrea L. Howard from Carleton University and Nancy L. Galambos from the University of Alberta. The research was funded by a grant awarded to N.

Read on\nPosted on November 29, 2016\n|\nBy: Meagan Boisse\n“Language is always a moving target,” says English professor Laura Dunbar.\nThe debate over what has been dubbed “university jargon” is open-ended, marked by the exasperated pleas of some to have intellectuals abandon their academic language in lieu of a common-sense vocabulary, and affirmations by others that disciplinary terminology is vital to higher learning.\nFrom the pages of The New York Times to those of scholarly journals , notable writers, academic and otherwise, have volleyed their opinions on the subject back and forth for years.\nHowever, the question persists — what role does academic language play in the pursuit of knowledge?\n“What it really comes down to is how we understand, make and convey meaning,” says Laura Dunbar , an assistant professor in Concordia’s Department of English who teaches composition and rhetoric.\nDunbar explains the essence of the problem is that for many people, including students coming into higher learning institutions, academic language is perceived as exclusive and an unnecessary obfuscation.\nJargon versus terminology\n“We need to accept and understand that students are struggling with what is really a second language,” says Dunbar, noting it takes time for starting scholars to adapt to literature often designed for a well-versed, highly specified audience.\nDunbar also notes that difficult does not necessarily translate into superfluous, however.\n“There's jargon and then there's terminology. Jargon is a term that comes with many negative connotations. When we think about jargon, we think about the car salesman; it invokes that sort of slick, glib image. However, academic terminology is an essential part of intellectual growth. Ideas do not always present themselves in simplistic ways.”\nMoreover, she is wary of charges that highly specialized language should be limited to only certain areas of academic inquiry .\n“When you or I study math, we expect there to be highly specialized formulas. We understand that that is the language of mathematics, so we don't say ‘well this is jargon and it should not be like this.’ Why then, do we have that expectation of the humanities? It is unrealistic to deny the need for concepts and theory in social and cultural studies.”\nAdvice for those struggling with university terms and concepts\nGetting the low-down on disciplinary lingo is no easy quest, but it’s important to have a vocabulary capable of effectively communicating highly complicated ideas. Every year, students find themselves becoming disoriented as they wade through pages of thick, academic prose. Luckily, there are a lot of resources available at Concordia.\n“First off, there's the good old-fashioned dictionary — to use language properly you have to understand what words mean. Additionally, there are peer resources such as writing assistants and learning and study skill specialists at the Student Success Centre ,” outlines Dunbar, adding: “There are also librarians, and of course there is always the professor. That’s what office hours are for!”\nFurthermore, Dunbar invites any students looking to improve their writing skills to take a class in composition .  \n“We're happy to help all students refine their ability to express themselves clearly in an academic milieu,” she says. “One really good exercise for students who are faced with dense theoretical thickets is to write a summary. It is a great strategy to move new material into that fund of deep learning.”\nDunbar suggests that students take notes while reading, and at the end of each chapter identify and paraphrase the key points of the text into their own words. Only after summarizing the text should they attempt to analyze and synthesize it.\n“Students can feel intimidated or embarrassed about asking for help, but they should remember that there are so many resources, so many people with expertise who are not just willing, but eager to help them. I really hope no student would ever feel like they're not supported.”\nFind out more about Concordia’s  Student Success Centre .\n \nKey terms you need to know\nAll students are subject to the administrative “jargon” employed by university staff and should familiarize themselves with this list of the more important terms. Doing so will come in extra handy when it’s time to register for and organize your class schedule.\nDNE (Did Not Enter): The DNE deadline is the date by which you can officially withdraw from a course without having to pay for it. If you drop a course before this deadline it won’t appear on either your student record or official transcript.\nDISC (Discontinued): If you miss the DNE deadline but still want to drop a course you can, as long as it’s done so before the DISC deadline. While it won’t affect your GPA, discontinuing a course will result in a DISC notation on your student record and official transcript. You will also be kept financially responsible for the payment of tuition and other fees pertaining to the course.\nCredits: A course that spans one semester typically is worth three credits, while a two-semester course is worth six credits. To be considered full-time you must register for a minimum of 12 credits and a maximum of 15 credits per semester. In general, an undergraduate degree require between 90-120 credits to complete.\nPermanent Code: The Quebec Ministry of Education requires all Quebec Universities to have a permanent code for each registered student on whose behalf the University receives funding. You can find your permanent code on your unofficial transcript,  accessible via MyConcordia Portal.\nAcademic year: Composed of two terms — a fall term (September to December) and a winter term (January to April), followed by a Summer Term (normally early May to mid-August)\nDeficiencies: A deficiency is a course you have not completed that is required for admission to your chosen program. Courses identified as “deficiencies” must be completed as early in your studies as possible.\nF/ABS (Fail/Absent): on your transcript is used when the instructor at the end of the course has not received the required work and has not granted an extension of the deadline. It is a permanent grade.\nCheck out the complete glossary of university terms and acronyms. \n \n"}

I began a Master’s Degree in 2014 with Dr. Grant E. Brown, where my research focused on studying Neophobia in Trinidadian Guppies.\nI was recently fast-tracked into the PhD program, where I will continue and expand upon my research. The amazing community of students, faculty, and staff at Concordia played a large role in my decision to stay for my PhD.\n In addition to pursuing graduate studies at Concordia, I am also the Science Liaison Officer for the Student Success Center, where I work with Student Learning Services to create and design improved study and tutoring programs for science students.\nThe resources available at Concordia and the wonderful support from both students and faculty have played a huge role in my academic success. I have built friendships and connections that will last a life time.\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo (Department of History):\nI am second-year MA History student. In my thesis, I explore the life and work of fin-de-siècle French literary critic, novelist, and traveller Thérèse (Th.) Bentzon, writing a history of her intellectual life across borders. Using Bentzon’s travelogues about the ‘condition of women’ in the United States and Canada as a starting point, I investigate the link between mobility, the development of feminism, and the making of a modern self in the nineteenth century. \nI came to history by way of journalism, having completed a BA in Journalism and German at Concordia. I was originally drawn to the Master’s program in History because of the groundbreaking work being done at the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.\nThat said, the History Department has given me the invaluable opportunity to explore my research interests in gender and women’s history, histories of empire, travel, global feminism, and autobiography and life writings. My supervisor, Dr. Barbara Lorenzkowski, grounds me in the historical craft while also encouraging me to forge links across disciplinary boundaries.\nPrior to starting graduate studies, my time as a student journalist took me to Istanbul, where I reported on the Gezi Park protests in 2013, and to Munich, where I worked in communications and penned a travel blog in the summer of 2014. As an early-career scholar, I aim to combine the storytelling elements of journalism with the academic rigueur of a historian through her work.\nI hope to pursue my PhD in History, looking at the comparative emergence of feminist ideologies in France and Britain in the nineteenth century, as of Fall 2017.\nRelated topics\n"}

It impacts our lives and the way we do things, and our researchers  are contributing to these developments” says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.\n“The patents that Concordia’s innovators have been awarded are the result of years of work, and dedication to the idea of taking research results an extra step and improving a process or a product.”\nFrom inception to commercialization\nMaria Amer , an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was honoured for a noise reduction technology she and her students developed. It improves brightness and colour information in digital images without blurring their details.\nAmer’s new video processing technology is now commercially available through a license deal with wrnch Inc., a company backed up Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban. The video denoising technology was later licensed to Red Giant, an American filmmaking and motion graphics company.\nAmer says her research is driven by the need to innovate, and that commercialization is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n“You cannot fully plan where you go as a researcher,” she adds.\n“I started with a technology in 2009, but it turned out not to be powerful enough against industrial denoisers competition. I felt the challenge to outperform what was currently available on the market, so I asked one of my PhD students to work on this and he excelled.”\nAmer is now working on video object tracking methods. Her goal is to fundamentally advance new technology and scientific knowledge in this area, but if she finds an industry niche, she and her team may turn their attention to applied research.\n \nMaria Amer's video denoising technology has been licensed to Red Giant , an American filmmaking and motion graphics company. | Image courtesy of Pond5 via Red Giant\nInnovating to meet society’s challenges\nEverything from online auction interfaces to self-sealing building materials have been developed at Concordia.\nHere are descriptions of other recently patented inventions:\nBetter braking and steering\nWaizuddin Ahmed , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, specializes in system dynamics and design for road and railway vehicles.\nHe holds a patent on an independently controlled active steering system that not only enhances handling but also improves braking-in-a-turn performance of road vehicles. The independent control is further realized using a fail-safe mechanism and has potential for numerous other applications in active chassis control technology.\nNew dimensions in data\nArmen Atoyan , a senior lecturer of mathematics and statistics in the Faculty of Arts and Science, holds a patent for a new method of record-fast interpolation of data points within a multi-dimensional dataset.\nHis invention is of particular interest for application in the area of digital image processing, including both still and real-time images.\nPurpose-built nanoparticles\nJohn Capobianco , professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, is a specialist in the synthesis, characterization and spectroscopy of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.\nHis patented technology, in part, upconverts nanoparticles’ near-infrared light into the UV, visible and red regions. The results of this research, conducted in collaboration with students and other associates, have attracted considerable attention due their potential biomedical applications in bioimaging, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.\nSmart sensors for surgery\nJavad Dargahi , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, is one of Canada’s leading experts in the application of haptic feedback systems\nIn his work with research associate Saeed Sokhanvar, he developed a patented smart tactile sensor and force and softness haptic feedback systems for robotic applications. His research could be implemented in hospitals offering minimally invasive, endoscopic surgeries.\nStronger, self-healing composites\nSuong Van Hoa , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has had marked success in obtaining patents for new inventions.\nOne area of his research focuses on the detection of defects in composite structures, such as airplanes, automobiles and wind turbines, to ensure that they are safe. His patents include an electrically conductive adhesive sheet for joining structural elements, a self-healing composite material designed to repair cracks and a system for making high-performance epoxies with clay particles.\nNew market mechanisms\nGregory Kersten , a professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, focuses on auctions and negotiations management\nHe developed an innovative market mechanism for procurement in computerized multi-attribute reverse auctions — a situation in which multiple sellers engage in a bidding process with a single buyer. Under Kersten’s mechanism, sellers are constrained to submit bids from admissible sets and the winner is selected by a pre-determined set of the buyer’s preferences that are unknown to the bidders.\nMiniature diagnostic tools\nMuthukumaran Packirisamy , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, has been prolific in developing new technologies, having recently patented five new discoveries.\nPackirisamy is a specialist in biomedical microelectromechanical systems, or BioMEMS. Many of his inventions have to do with the miniaturization of photonic components for information technologies and diagnostic tools for health care to detect cancer and other illnesses that may be lurking in a person’s bloodstream. His latest work involves a power cell that harnesses electrical energy from the photosynthesis and respiration of blue-green algae.\nMore efficient heating systems\nGeorgios Vatistas , a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, who has gained international renown for proving Nobel Prize-winner J.J. Thomson’s 125-year-old theorem on the stability of vortex rings, is an expert in research about how vortices can make energy exchange more economical.\nHis recently patented heat exchanger technology, which uses four to six times less energy to operate and is considerably smaller than a traditional shell-and-tube exchanger, and uses 40 times less energy to operate than the traditional plate heat exchanger, builds on his previous work in swirling water and air flows.\nFind out more about  resources for Concordia researchers .\nPresentations at Concordia's Technology and Innovation Recognition event were also made by some of the university's partners in innovation support, including Aligo Innovation, TandemLaunch and Fasken Martineau.\n \n"}

Studies of infants' cognitive abilities in non-social domains (including object cognition, numerical cognition and spatial cognition) shed light on the starting points for human cognitive development. Together with studies of these cognitive abilities in other animals, at other ages, and with other methods from the cognitive and brain sciences, this research suggests deep properties of physical and mathematical reasoning in older children and adults. Here I ask whether studies of infants can bring similar insights into human social cognition. Do the complex social inferences and intuitions of adults develop from, and build on, simpler systems that are functional in infants? If so, what are the properties of these systems, and what roles do they play in the richer social reasoning that emerges later in development? Recent studies of human infants, using simple behavioral methods, suggest that the answers to these questions may lie within reach. I describe some new findings and call for a multi-species, multi-leveled search for the core mechanisms by which humans navigate the social world.\n"}

Can genetics explain a crazy cat lady’s love for felines? How does DNA lead to people with no fingerprints, or humans born with tails? And how did the right combination of genes create the exceptionally flexible thumbs and fingers of a truly singular violinist? Unraveling the genetic code hasn’t always been easy—from its earliest days, genetics has been rife with infighting, backstabbing, and controversial theories—but scientists can now finally read the astounding stories inscribed in our DNA. As we make advances into DNA mapping and modification, genetics will continue to be the hottest topic in science, shaping the very makeup of our bodies and the world around us. With the same masterful combination of science, history, and culture he brought to The Disappearing Spoon, Sam Kean untangles the secrets of our genetic code, explaining how genetics has shaped our past, and how DNA will determine humankind’s future.\nTHE SPEAKER: \nSam Kean is author of the New York Times bestsellers The Disappearing Spoon and The Violinist’s Thumb.

Wilson\nABSTRACT: How can we become happier, help teenagers navigate the problems of adolescence, reduce racial prejudice, and help college students adjust to university life? Initially these seem like very different problems. I suggest, however, that they are all rooted in the stories people tell themselves to make sense of the world. These stories, or personal narratives, ultimately determine whether people lead healthy, productive lives or have problems. Sometimes, psychotherapy is called for to help people revise their stories. Often people are at a narrative fork in the road. They aren’t quite sure what to make of their situation or how to explain it. Social psychologists have discovered a promising approach, called “story-editing,” that nudges people down healthy narrative paths. I will discuss story-editing interventions that have been used in a variety of areas (e.g., to help college students experiencing academic problems, reduce teenage pregnancy, increase personal happiness) and discuss the promise and limitations of these interventions.\nTHE SPEAKER: Timothy D. Wilson is Sherrell J. Aston Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia. He has published over 100 articles in scholarly journals and edited books, primarily on the topics of self-knowledge, unconscious processing, and personal happiness. His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Russell Sage Foundation. Wilson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009. At the University of Virginia, he has won an All University Outstanding Teacher Award and the Distinguished Scientist Award. In 2002 Wilson published Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious (Harvard University Press). The New York Times Magazine listed the book as containing one of the best 100 ideas of 2002. In 2011 he published, Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change (Little, Brown). The author Malcolm Gladwell said, “There are few academics who write with as much grace and wisdom as Timothy Wilson. I thought his last book Strangers to Ourselves was a masterpiece.

McComas\nParks Family Endowed Professorship in Science Education, University of Arkansas\nABSTRACT: Darwin’s “Mad Dream” as he put it refers to pangenesis, an idea he proposed to describe the rules of inheritance and explain the source of new variation. These conceptions were vital to evolution by natural selection. Beyond historians of biology, few others are familiar with pangenesis because it was ultimately shown to be inaccurate and represents one of Darwin’s few errors. The case of pangenesis is not interesting because it was incorrect, but because the account of its development provides an interesting case study into how science works and offers a rare glimpse into Darwin’s thinking and personality. Pangenesis can illustrate important “nature of science” ideas such as the need for empirical evidence, the use of inductive reasoning, the creative component of science, the role of bias and subjectivity, social and personal influences on science, and the notion that scientific knowledge is tentative but durable, and ultimately self-correcting.\nTHE SPEAKER: McComas is widely involved in many areas of science education. He has served on the boards of directors of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), the International History, Philosophy and Science Teaching Group (IHPST), the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) and the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE). He is a recipient of the Outstanding Evolution Educator and Research in Biology Teaching awards from NABT, the Ohaus award for Innovations in College Science Teaching and the ASTE Outstanding Science Teacher Educator award. He is interested in the improvement of laboratory instruction, evolution education, the intersection of the philosophy of science and science teaching, science for gifted students, and science instruction in museums and field sites. McComas was recently a Fulbright Fellow in residence at the Centre for the Advancement of Science and Mathematics Teaching and Learning (CASTeL) at Dublin City University in Ireland.\n"}

All the above examples are drawn from the history of the post-World War II science of cybernetics—the study of control and communication in animals and machines. This talk suggests that each example acts out a vision of the world radically different from that of modern science and western commonsense. The talk will explore the politics of cybernetics, suggesting that its aim is an experimental openness to what the world has to offer, rather than a grim quest for domination and control.\nTHE SPEAKER: Andrew Pickering began life as a physicist, with his first degree from Oxford and a PhD in particle physics from University College London.

But this level of stewardship carries with it the burden and responsibility of international leadership in the protection, conservation, and sustainable exploitation of marine biodiversity. Has Canada accepted the responsibility its geography demands? How have fisheries and aquaculture affected Canada’s past and present ocean life, and how might climate change affect it in the future? Biological depredation of waters bordered by the world’s longest coastline ultimately reflects ineffectual leadership and disingenuous commitment to environmental sustainability. Governmental and societal lip service need to be replaced by meaningful responses to over-exploitation and climate change.

For most of the twentieth century, evolutionary theory was restricted to the biological sciences and avoided most human-related subjects. That is now rapidly changing, as virtually every human-related subject is being approached from an evolutionary perspective. As soon as evolution is perceived as unthreatening, explanatory, and useful for understanding the human condition and improving human welfare, it can become not just acceptable but irresistible.\nTHE SPEAKER: David Sloan Wilson is SUNY Distinguished Professor of Biology and Anthropology at Binghamton University. He applies evolutionary theory to all aspects of humanity in addition to the rest of life, both in his own research and as director of EvoS, a unique campus-wide evolutionary studies programme.

Already with research into the healthy and diseased brain, novel interventions on the brain are flourishing. These range from advances in neuroimaging research yielding insights into neurological disorders, behaviour and personality to developments in neurosurgical stimulation for motor and neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the importance of the brain in defining who we are and the vulnerability of neurological and psychiatric patients, neuroscience increasingly intersects with crucial ethical, legal, and social issues. We have never perhaps faced so directly the consequences and responsibilities that modern biomedical science bestows upon us as we will with the neuroscience revolution. I will discuss briefly the ethical aspects of basic and clinical neuroscience, “neuroethics” and some of the key challenges in current and future applications of neuroscience. Also, a framework of neuroethical responsibilities including scientific integrity and public engagement will be proposed to tackle challenges in neuroscience.\nTHE SPEAKER: Eric Racine, PhD, is the Director of the Neuroethics Research Unit at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal (IRCM).

Many rules of physics that apply in a real scene are, however, optional in a painting. The artist can choose transgressions of standard physics?such as impossible shadows, colors, reflections or contours?and use these as shortcuts or for effect. Their use often goes completely unnoticed. As artists discover these shortcuts, bending the laws of physics without penalty, they act as research neuroscientists and much can be learned from tracking down their discoveries. The goal is not to expose the \"slip-ups\" of the masters?as entertaining as that might be. Instead it is to understand the reduced set of rules that the brain uses to comprehend the world.\nTHE SPEAKER: Patrick Cavanagh was born in Oakville, Ontario in 1947. He received a degree in Electrical Engineering from McGill University in 1968. An interest in artificial intelligence led to a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from Carnegie-Mellon in 1972. He taught first at the Université de Montréal in Psychology and in 1989 he moved to Harvard as professor of Psychology. In 2007 he accepted a Chaire d'Excellence at the Université Paris Descartes. His current projects study the roles of visual attention in selecting and creating visual representations, and the properties and strategies of visual attention in normal and brain-damaged subjects. He has also explored how various features such as shadow, color, motion, and texture contribute to representations of visual form. These experiments led to his interest in art as a source of data for neuroscience.\n"}

This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.\n“This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,” said Roy. “I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.” \nThree of this year’s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success.\nDavid Tagliamonti\nBachelor of Science – Actuarial Mathematics\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nMake a reading/homework/study schedule in week one of your term and stick to it.\nPush yourself to ask \"why?\" This will deepen your understanding of course material.\nStay healthy. Regularly playing a sport or going to the gym will keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused in school.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nA problem often has many solutions. The science is in finding a solution; the art is in finding the best one.\nUniversity is a great time to learn from others — not just professors, but fellow students as well.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nKeep learning long after your formal education comes to an end.\nCristy Vista\nMember of the Institute for Co-operative Education\nThree keys to a good education:\nListen earnestly to your professors when they give a lecture, and to your colleagues when they share their thoughts. Understanding others can widen our own perspective.\nDon't let confusion build up — it can hamper learning. Clarify concepts or processes you don't understand as soon as you hear about them.\nLearning should not be a lonely process. When you're having a hard time, ask for help. Concordia has many resources you can tap.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nInformation is never neutral. It must not be simply digested, but carefully examined and reflected on.\nThe world is built in a way that we are unequal and completely reliant on each other. The comforts we may have are at the expense of others, and this makes us our brother’s keeper.\nOne piece of advice for other students:\nStudying to just get the grade can be tedious and off-putting. Relate your coursework to your passions, long-term goals and aspirations. This approach can give you encouragement during difficult times. \n \nBachelor of Arts – Linguistics\nThree keys to a good education:\nFirst off, it requires professors that not only teach what they love, but who teach you how to think critically and nurture high-quality ignorance. In other words, they teach you how to express your curiosity in meaningful and practical ways.\nA good education is one that helps you develop skills that will serve you throughout your entire life.\nFinally, it involves a network of people that constantly encourage and motivate you to thrive.\nTwo lessons learned at FAS:\nThere are many resources in place to help us succeed at Concordia. We are fortunate to have advisors, committees and activities for everyone.\nI also learned to take classes from different departments. FAS has hundreds of different courses offered. This allows us to view the world from multiple perspectives.\nOne piece of advice to fellow students:\nBe resilient and passionate — the rest will follow!\n \n"}

That ability has certainly helped her in her career with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) LLP in Montreal.\n \nHer experience and expertise has also led Miriam to be named a recipient of the Women’s Executive Network’s (WXN) 2015 Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Awards. She was honoured at a gala hosted by the WXN at The Westin Montreal in April.\nMiriam Pozza is a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in Montreal and leads the Deals practice in Quebec. This year she celebrates a quarter-century with the company. | Photo credit: Claudia Landry\n“It’s always nice to have recognition when you put effort into your work, your personal development and the development of your team,” she says.\nAt Concordia, Pozza studied in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. “I was interested in anything that had to do with numbers and understanding our economy through numbers,” she says. “That’s what led me to the world of finance.”\nPozza joined the professional services network of PwC in 1991.\nShe says that her passion in assisting entrepreneurs and corporations in their growth has led her into the world of mergers and acquisitions.\nShe’s worked determinedly to distinguish herself in this competitive field.\n \nAfter spending several years in both the auditing and valuation departments — eventually receiving designations as a Chartered Professional Accountant and Chartered Business Valuator — Pozza became Deals leader for the Quebec Region in 2013.\n \nHer main function, she explains, is to help her colleagues work together towards the common goal of accompanying clients in their transactions. Aspects of the job that she finds particularly rewarding are the challenges of completing a deal, and helping companies grow to meet their full potential.\n \nPozza says her commitment to personal and professional development, coupled with her natural leadership qualities, has made her an important asset to the various organizations she has supported throughout her career.\n \n“If you view yourself as fortunate, and I do, I think giving back to the community is rewarding,” she says.\n \nFor 10 years, Pozza lent her accounting skills to the YWCA Montreal by acting as a treasurer on its board of directors. She also sits on the fundraising committee of La Fondation Armand-Frappier, a research institute in the life sciences sector.\n \n“Medicine and wellbeing were always something that I found of great interest,” she says, adding that her ambition was to become a doctor when she was younger.\n \nPozza also supports the advancement of women to leadership positions through her directorship with the Quebec Association of Women in Finance (AFFQ). In 2012, the AFFQ awarded her the Recognition Award for her tireless dedication.\n“I find it important to be part of this association and to specifically assist women in their development, by helping them build a network and develop their skills,” she says.\n \nDescribed previously by PwC CEO Bill McFarland as a natural mentor, Pozza believes strongly that building a network of mentors helps women develop their careers in the long run.\n \nThe best mentors, she says, will take an interest in your values and guide you out of your comfort zone. “Sometimes you need that little push to take some risks.”\n#CUalumni\n"}

They stood beside posters bearing details about their work terms and what they had gained from their various on-the-job experiences.\nMegan Brown, who graduated from Concordia’s computer science program last fall, spent her final work term at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, where she developed an application for a remote-controlled car that can be operated using any Windows 10 device.\nBrown has accepted a job with the software behemoth, and she’s relocating to Washington in a few weeks.\nComputer engineering student Vincent Bilodeau spent his last work term at the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, optimizing audio effects and performing hardware performance profiling. “It’s pretty cool, you get to work on something, then play guitar, work on it a little more, then play some more guitar,” he said, smiling.\nBilodeau has a few courses left before he graduates, but he signed a contract for freelance work with Fender this summer, and he’s hopeful about his prospects for a future with the company.\nAccountancy student Nicholas Chin recently completed a work term at the professional services company KPMG where he helped corporate executives with their personal tax returns. He’s found his passion, he said. But before looking for his first job after he graduates this spring, he’s going to take some time off to travel. The ticket to Italy’s already booked. \n \nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi (far left) and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau (second from left) shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award.\nCo-op’s $8 million contribution\nHughes provided some figures to illustrate the program’s growth and diversity: Currently there are more than 40 Co-op programs at Concordia, including three new ones this year, in mathematical and computational finance , biology and aerospace engineering .\nClose to 1,800 students are enrolled as Co-op members, and they secured 1,400 work placements over the past year. On an annual basis, students in the program earn in the neighbourhood of $8 million. “This helps them with their education, but it also helps the local economy,” Hughes said.\nA vital bridge\nCatherine Bolton , Concordia’s vice-provost for teaching and learning, compared Co-op to a bridge, connecting the classroom to the workplace. “It results in an increase of possibilities — to communicate, to meet, to work together and to learn from each other,” she said. “This bridge partnership is vital to us, not only at the Co-op institute but also at Concordia.”\nBolton underlined the role Co-op’s experiential learning opportunities play in Concordia’s new strategic directions.\n“ Embrace the city, embrace the world speaks to the idea that Concordians can use their talents, expertise and energy to affect social change and to give back to the community that we live in, whether it's locally or globally,” Bolton said. “It is very clear that Co-op students and Co-op employers have long been helping us to achieve this goal.”\nCo-op’s ‘win-win’\nCo-op employer Angela D’Angelo, vice-president of training and client experience at National Bank Financial, highlighted the benefits of hiring Co-op students. “It’s win-win. It’s a two-way street,” she said. “You have no idea what these millennials can bring to your business, to your life and to your development.”\nThis year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award .\nDe Masi said being a part of Co-op allowed her to face her fears and anxieties head on and develop the confidence needed to decide her career direction. “I've learned that it's important not to let people place you in a labelled box and tell you that that’s what you have to be in life,” she said. “I'll kick the box open and politely say, ‘No, thank you.’”\nBoudreau praised Co-op for allowing students to gain invaluable experience while working for employers who take a vested interest in developing their interns. “I really experienced this working on flight simulators and antennas for satellites. It was really remarkable to work with so many employers who would just listen, and be there when you needed help,” he said.\n“I learned to think a little less like a student and a little more like an engineer, and it reflected in the way that I came back to school.”\n"}

The professional web-based service connects businesses wishing to boost their online presence with high-quality freelancers that have the skills to make it happen.\nIt’s the brainchild of Liverani and husband Mikael Cho. The couple, ages 26 and 29, co-founded the company three years ago along with partners Luke Chesser and Angus Woodman.\nThe 1,000-square-metre ground-floor space of this historical building, which has retained the original tile, stone and brickwork, will also house a co-working space and café when it opens its doors in April 2016.\n“We have quite a lot of freelancers that are based in Montreal, and we had to get a new office space anyway,” Liverani says. “We figured, let’s have a physical presence and show what Crew looks like in the real world.”\nAs chief operating officer, Liverani helps define new product features, assures quality, sets up team processes, is responsible for hiring, and manages investor relations and the future of Crew.\nSince tripling its staff in 2014 — the company now employs upwards of 30 people — she admits that maintaining a good work-life balance is challenging.\n“There’s always something to do. It’s about finding that time where you can just think, maybe go for a walk,” says Liverani.\nFor her, this precious personal time is early in the morning when her Chow Chow dog begs to be taken out for a stroll.\nStaying on top of things takes a lot of self-discipline — a skill Liverani says she learned during her time at Concordia.\nA lifelong love of math led her to study actuarial mathematics in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. Motivated by the challenging and fast-paced nature of her studies, she was dismayed when her first job offered little more than a 9-to-5 grind in a tiny cubicle.\n“What I learned in school was very different than what happened when I graduated and went into the real world of working,” she says.\nDisillusioned, Liverani decided to make a career change after just one year in the actuarial field. Meanwhile, Cho — a designer — had grown tired of working in an agency and was ready to do something different.\nWith a $25,000 investment from FounderFuel — a Montreal-based startup accelerator that helps young entrepreneurs refine their vision into deliverable products — the couple co-founded Crew in 2012. Last year, the company raised more than $12 million.\n“In terms of learning how to start a business, it’s a lot of trial and error and listening to your gut,” Liverani says. “I think a lot of that stuff you can’t get in textbooks.”\n#CUalumni\n"}

Latimer\nFour actuarial students from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are celebrating a big win: they recently took home $20,000 from the second annual 2016 Munich Re Cup .\nThe Munich Re Cup — named after the sponsor, a global reinsurance company — is a national actuarial case competition open to teams from the Society of Actuaries'   Centers of Actuarial Excellence . These are university and college actuarial programs that meet specific  requirements  related to degree, curriculum, graduate count, faculty composition, graduate quality and connection to industry and research.\n“Concordia is one of eight Centers of Actuarial Excellence across Canada, and 30 worldwide,” says José Garrido , graduate program director and the first actuarial professor hired by Concordia back in 1986. “We’re the only English co-operative education program in Quebec.”\n“Winning the cup proves that our program is focusing on the right things,” he says. “It was designed to provide students with an opportunity to develop and apply their analytical, presentation and problem-solving skills to a real-world business problem … And the $20,000 in prize money is pretty nice!”\nOn March 12, students David Tagliamonti, Jasmine Lemay-Dagenais, Roxanne Côté and Ryan D'Orazio represented Concordia in Toronto at Munich Re headquarters, where seven teams competed. Each team was given the same case to solve four weeks beforehand.\nThis year’s case was “Specialty Drugs: How Do You Manage the Risk?”\n“Some new drugs are super expensive per treatment,” explains D’Orazio, a third-year actuarial student and a member of the Institute for Co-operative Educatio n.\n“So, how do we handle so many high-cost claims? We proposed providing less coverage for small claims, in a tiered solution that provides peace of mind. In addition, we proposed the implementation of certain drug-cost management strategies to decrease spending for both specialty and traditional drugs. These elements work in harmony to form a solution that is economically sound for the client, affordable for plan sponsors and attractive for plan members.”\nEach team submitted a one-page executive summary, individual team member profiles and an electronic copy of their presentation.\n“Munich Re liked that our team focused on the plan member — the end user,” says Tagliamonti, a team member and Co-op student, who is graduating in December. “The experience confirmed my belief that I’m going to like a career as an actuary.”\nLemay-Dagenais concurs. “Our team had the chance to work on a highly relevant issue to the group benefits insurance industry,” she says.\n“Having each had different previous work experiences, all of us contributed differently to the project. It was definitely a rewarding experience, and we were able to obtain valuable feedback from the judging panel.” \nMost of the team members heard about the Munich Re Cup via the student newsletter produced by the Mathematics Actuarial Statistics Student Association (MASSA) .\n“To apply, we each wrote a one-page essay about why we wanted to compete, then we approached our program director, Patrice Gaillardetz ,” says D’Orazio. “I learned so much, like the importance of taking a strong business perspective and taking into account how all parties are affected.”\nCôté believes that one of the most valuable assets a student can have in her field is experience.\n“This is mainly why I registered for the Munich Re Cup in the first place, which turned out to be a very gratifying experience,” she says. “Not only have I learned about the reinsurance industry, but I also gained a lot of analytical skills, creativity and confidence.”\nThe burning question: what are the students going to do with their $5,000 prize money?\n“Invest it safely and wisely!” says Tagliamonti, with a laugh.\n"}

It’s not just, here’s a formula and use it,” explains Hyndman.\nThis Co-op program will follow a new model: rather than applying straight out of CEGEP, students will complete one term of courses at Concordia before being eligible for a Co-op schedule with three work terms.\n“We’re going to have students who have more program-specific knowledge when they do their first work term,” says Hyndman of the decision to structure the program differently.\nExamples of the fields of Co-op work available to students include finance, capital markets, investment banking, treasury, risk management and insurance.\n“This also allows us to present multiple Co-op options to an employer to make it that much more interesting to partner with us,” explains Gerry Hughes, director of the Institute for Co-operative Education. He’s quick to praise Hyndman’s and senior program coordinator Nadine Benjamin’s efforts to get this new option off the ground.\n“Cody is a very dynamic leader who is fully committed to our Co-op program,” Hughes says. “His total dedication is very much appreciated. All of these programs have become some of our top ‘flagship’ Co-op programs at Concordia.”\nDaniel Eklove, BA 13, says this Co-op option provides valuable networking opportunities for students that can translate into future employment offers. “One thing that I've noticed in the couple of years since graduating is that there's a big hole in the financial workforce just waiting to be filled by MACF graduates. But it's not an obvious hole. It's subtle.”\nEklove is speaking both as a student and a potential boss. “Now, as an employer, this program is a good opportunity to explore potential future talent while connecting with my alma mater,” he says.\nHyndman is looking forward to getting the show on the road. “I think this is going to be a very popular option with students, and one which will help them launch successful careers upon graduating.”\nBiology: ‘There is a need for qualified interns’\nBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the food industry, environmental testing firms, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, hospitals, universities — there are plenty of places that benefit from biology graduates’ scientific expertise.\nStarting this fall, undergraduates students enrolled in the Department of Biology at Concordia will be able to gain invaluable on-the-job experience during their studies thanks to the department’s new Co-op option.\n“There is a need in industry for qualified interns,” says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , a senior lecturer in the Department of Biology who spearheaded the creation of the biology Co-op program, one of only two in the province.\nShe says the opportunity to alternate work and study terms will likely attract more top-notch biology undergraduates to Concordia.\n“What students do outside of the regular curriculum is so important,” she says, “They have to have a good CV when they graduate, because when they start looking for a job, it's already too late.”\nLucia Plescia, coordinator at the Institute for Co-operative Education, says the plan is to grow the program sustainably, ensuring that Co-op students are set up with engaging and dynamic work opportunities.\nShe adds that students who do apply will be encouraged to be open to working anywhere in Quebec, Canada or even internationally. “This will enhance and diversify the quality of work terms as well as provide enriching life experiences,\" she says.\nGray-Mitsumune agrees that flexibility is key, pointing out the federal government’s need for qualified interns to carry out research in the field. “One example might be a station in Mont-Joli that hires undergraduate students for fish studies.”  \nTo be eligible for the biology Co-op program, students must be enrolled in a specialization or honours program and have a CRC (La cote de rendement au collégial) score of 28.00 or higher. However, even students who meet the requirements are not guaranteed admittance to the program.\nThose who want to find out more about the selection process are encouraged to contact the institute.\nThe biology Co-op option consists of six study terms and three work terms, completed consecutively over a three-year period, including summer terms.\n“We are always looking to increase the depth and breadth of experiential learning opportunities for students,” says Hughes.\n“We were delighted to provide the support to both departments in getting these programs up and running, and obviously we’re all excited to begin accepting the first cohort and preparing them for future academic and professional success.”\nFind out more about Concordia’s Institute for Co-operative Education .\n \n"}

A match was soon made with Aviva Canada, an insurance company that had worked with Mitacs and Concordia students in the past.\nAt Aviva, Nawar is using her research to help the company improve its decision making for insurance rates so it can manage costly claims — a process known as risk modelling. “The idea is to give Aviva a competitive advantage in this area by improving their overall accuracy in predicting claim severities and frequencies.”\nHer supervisor at Aviva, Charles Dugas — who also happens to be a former Mitacs participant — sees Nawar as vital to improving important processes the company depends upon to stay competitive.\n“It’s a fast-paced business and we don’t always have the time to develop and test new ideas,” he says.\n“Having a bright, hardworking student examining how we do our business is invaluable. Sandra is also a vital link for us when it comes to the newest trends in research and development that are being discussed in academia, something that can get lost in the daily grind of the business world.”\nFor students at all stages of research\nNawar’s graduate supervisor, Jose Garrido , a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics , is a huge proponent of the Mitacs program. To date, he has referred four students he has supervised.\n“For students who are in the early process of their research, a Mitacs internship can give them ideas as to how to further develop their work,” says Garrido. “For those in the later stages, it’s a chance to take their idea and run with it in a way that can benefit a company.”\nWhen it comes to Nawar, Garrido believes her success at Aviva is a direct result of her drive and personality. “Sandra is the type of student who can’t only live in theory, she needed to get her hands dirty and put her research to work. This kind of outlet and experience will give her a great advantage once she graduates.”\nIf you are a student or a supervisor interested in the variety of programs offered by Mitacs, contact Jean-Philippe Valois, director of Business Development, at jpvalois@mitacs.ca or 514-575-0425.\n \n"}

What makes the contest special, Pelczer says, is that it's accessible to all young students, regardless of their mathematical abilities. \n\"The problems are designed with different levels of difficulty, so everybody can do something. And even though it's not far from the school curriculum, the problems are still formulated in an interesting way, so it's not just plain calculation.\"\nAs Sierpinska points out, the competition is particularly popular among students in elementary school.\n\"The young children have fun with math, that's it. They have friends there, and they just come and enjoy themselves — playing with children who have the same kinds of interests as they have, thinking about a problem and twisting it around.\"\nStudents who return tend to do better, Pelczer says. \"They come back and they're stronger, so we have better results every year at the national level, not just at the local level.\"\nThere's even a component of the contest for parents who've come to cheer on their children, so they can flex their perhaps long-dormant math muscles.\n\"It's a compilation of problems to give them a feeling of what it's about,\" Pelczer says. \nAs asssociate professor  Nadia Hardy  explains, engaging the Montreal community is important to Department of Mathematics and Statistics .\n\"Whether it's hosting or participating in mathematical competitions for elementary to high school children, or sponsoring mathematical competitions and student-related activities, we are dedicated to continuing our involvement, and finding new ways of increasing our outreach.”\nFind out more about the  2016 Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest  at Concordia.\n \n"}

She spends Sunday mornings exploring logic problems, Dirichlet's principle and geometry, among other things.\nHosted by Concordia, in a joint project with l' Institut des sciences mathématiques (ISM) , the Montreal Math Circle is a self-funded, independent enrichment program for young students — grades three to eight — interested in solving math problems at their school level. After two successful pilot sessions last fall, a third held in January and the fourth will start on February 21 and run until March 13.\n“Math Circle breaks out of the traditional teacher-student model, with more informal collaboration and brainstorming,” Tsypin says.\nHow it works\nFacilitated by Alina Stancu , associate professor in Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics and ISM director, and run by PhD candidate Ildiko Pelczer, Math Circle divides students into three groups according to age and grade. On average, there are 10 kids per age group — half are girls, in the younger sections.\nThey work individually and collectively on the same problems during the 90-minute, Sunday morning sessions led by Pelczer.\n“There’s a need for this kind of thing in Montreal,” says Pelczer, who started doing four-hour mathematical Olympiads in Romania in grade seven. “It shows that math is creative and the students have the freedom to be inventive. And we work on the kind of contest questions that you don’t usually see in school.”\nFour-prong outreach\nMontreal Math Circle is just one of four math outreach initiatives by Concordia. Another is the Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest , a 20-year-old worldwide math competition that debuted in Canada in 2001. Anna Sierpinska , a Concordia professor who specializes in math education, initiated hosting the contest at Concordia in 2012. Since then, she has remained involved, and the contest’s hosting is organized by Pelczer and department administrator Jane Venettacci.\nThe registration deadline for the next Kangaroo contest is March 7, for the March 20 event. Over 200 students are expected.\n“Engaging the Montreal community in mathematics and statistics is important to us, whether hosting or participating in mathematical competitions for elementary to high-school children, or sponsoring mathematical competitions and student-related activities,” says Nadia Hardy , associate professor of mathematics and chair of the department.\n“We are dedicated to continuing our involvement, and finding new ways of increasing our outreach.”\nTournament of Towns\nConcordia’s third and newest outreach initiative is the international mathematics competition called Tournament of Towns . It’s a problem-solving contest for students up to the age of 18 that began in Russia in the late 1970s.\n“More than 120 cities participate, from more than 25 countries,” says Stancu. “The main goal of this tournament is to provide an opportunity for a large number of students to participate in a competition with worldwide standards. Some problems can be very challenging, yet they require creative use of simple tools rather than advanced mathematical knowledge.”\nThe next tournament is scheduled for February 28. It will be held on the Sir George Williams Campus. To register, email each student’s name and school grade to montrealmathclub@gmail.com by February 23.\nFormula of Unity\nThe fourth outreach initiative is the International Mathematical Olympiad Formula of Unity/The Third Millennium for students from grades six to 12. Organized by the Saint Petersburg State University and the Euler Foundation, it was first held in the 2013-14 academic year. During the 2014-15 edition, it gathered more than 6,000 students from 15 countries.\nIn Montreal, the tournament is facilitated by Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics and  l'Institut des sciences mathématiques (ISM). \nIt takes place in two rounds. The second round — which invites students who received the best results in the first round — will be held on February 21. \nExponential growth?\n“Right now, we are creating a vibrant math community, which is very important to all, and we hope to add to our activities a one or two-week summer camp,” says Stancu. “The challenge will be getting the right logistics support with things like payroll, legal issues, general administration. The enthusiasm from the kids is already there.”\nTo register your child for the next Montreal Math Circle session, which runs from February 21 until March 13, email  montrealmathclub@gmail.com , indicating your name, and the name and school grade of your child.\nThe next Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest takes place on March 20. Register your child by March 7.\nThe next Tournament of Towns contest is February 28. It will be held in Room MB-1.437, John Molson Building (MB), Sir George Williams Campus. The four-hour contest starts at 11:30 a.m. To register, email each student’s name and school grade to montrealmathclub@gmail.com by February 23.\n \n"}

Student Jason Azzoparde tells us\nOn February 5, Concordia's national finalist shadowed the president of PSP Investments\nPosted on February 5, 2016\n|\nBy: Jason Azzoparde\nUndergraduate Jason Azzoparde, a student in Concordia's  Department of Mathematics and Statistics  and a member of the  Institute for Co-operative Education , was recently selected as one of 18 finalists in the annual CEO for a Day competition , run by executive search firm Odgers Berndtson. \nThe fourth-year student in actuarial mathematics and finance  spent yesterday, February 5, shadowing André Bourbonnais, president and CEO of PSP Investments .\nIt was an opportunity to network with top level executives and learn about their roles in the company. Here's Azzoparde's story about his day at the top of the corporate ladder. \nMorning meeting at PSP\nThe day began with a breakfast in André Bourbonnais's office. Daniel Garant, executive vice-president and chief investment officer (CIO), was also in attendance. This was an opportunity to introduce ourselves and speak about our interests in the financial markets. André and Daniel advised me on their current market outlook and where they see opportunities to tailor their global portfolio.   \nHuman resources and talent management takeaways\nThe next stop was Guy Archambault's office, senior vice-president of Human Resources and Talent Management. Guy explained how he built the human resources structure from when the company was at about 10 per cent of its current size. He also informed me about current headwinds he is facing in the fast-growing company.\nSonia Goyette, senior director of Talent Management also gave me a glimpse of her recruiting strategies for both experienced professionals and new graduates. The CEO even challenged me on a real human capital management case regarding relocation compensation. A CEO must constantly weigh the opportunities of reducing compensation costs while still minimizing the talent turnover rate. \n \nTense moments on the trading floor\nThis was by far the most exciting part of the day! I was given a quick summary of the public market trading activities, both on the equity and derivatives side. The trading operations of the institution are fast-paced and these analysts must perform market transactions in a very limited time frame. I even had the privilege of witnessing a real-life arbitrage strategy as the trader walked me through the transaction. I must admit that my heart rate was racing as we were approaching the execution of the deal!\nMore insights over lunch\nLunch was scheduled at Decca 77 with Anik Lanthier, senior vice-president of Public Equities and Absolute Return, Stephane Jalbert, managing director in Real Estate Investments, and Guthrie Stewart, senior vice-president and global head of Private Investments. I had the opportunity to learn more about their successful careers and certain challenges they faced along the way.\n$100-million deals and a leader with impressive poise \nThe afternoon began with an investment pitch from Hong Kong investors. I was able to meet the chairman and CEO of the fund and attentively analyze the deal proposal. These meetings are key to the success of PSP in developing a well-diversified portfolio. Not to mention, many deals are executed for way over $100 million!\nMr. Bourbonnais has a long-lasting relationship with many of his overseas business partners and observing him in action was impressive, to say the least. Finally, a presentation was conducted at the PSP office by a top Canadian bank. The CEO and other senior executive members were present to exchange business ideas. It was an intimidating, yet humbling feeling to be sitting alongside two distinguished Canadian CEOs.\nLooking back on my day, I can truly say that a CEO’s life has multiple dimensions to it. The culture a leader brings to a corporation is key to growth and sustainability. André is a well-rounded individual, one that cares for his people while demanding nothing short of excellence. A true leader by heart, André has demonstrated that the right mix of passion, vision and intelligence can go a long way toward building a successful career. \n \nRead about how Jason Azzoparde earned the Bourse Gilles Joncas in 2014 , given to the top co-op student in Quebec by the provincial branch of the Association canadienne de l’enseignement cooperative (ACDEC). \n \n"}

He is survived by his wife Fauzia Begum, their son Syed Furrokh-Nabeel Ali (Samira Karim), and grandson Syed Aydin Karim Ali.\nTwareque completed his doctoral studies in mathematical physics at the University of Rochester in1973.  After periods of research and teaching in ICTP Trieste, University of Toronto, UPEI, and ITP Clausthal, Germany, he joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Concordia University in 1981.  He was promoted to full professor here in 1990.\nTwareque pursued research in many areas of mathematics, mostly in analysis, functional analysis, and quantum mechanics.  He published his work with numerous scientists around the world in over 120 research articles and in a number of books. He was always studying and preparing lectures, now wavelets, now differential geometry, now group theory. His presentations were structured, lucid, interesting, deep, and, before the fashion of electronic displays, by means of perfectly clear handwriting on the blackboard. \nHe was not inclined to profess an overt teaching philosophy but an observer might infer that it was ‘empowerment through mathematical understanding’.  He was himself impressively erudite with an eclectic taste that included history, philosophy and literature, and the mastery of at least five European languages in addition to Bengali and Hindi, and some Farsi and Arabic.\nHe was extremely generous and engendered enormous affection in his students and colleagues. He had an amusing story or anecdote for almost every occasion – often related to other mathematicians he knew from his extensive travels – and had a repertoire of funny jokes that naturally prompted his distinctive laughter.\nHis inspiring presence and cheerful demeanor will be sorely missed by us all.\nTestimonials can be sent  here  for publication.\nMarch 17, 2016\nWith deep sorrow, I learned about the passing of Dr. Ali.\nTwareque was a very well known scientist, with important contributions in the field of Mathematics and Physics, but even more important he was an exceptional human being.\nI first met him in Havana, Cuba in the nineties. Had the honour to organize, jointly with him, the first workshop in Wavelets and Quantization Methods at the University of Havana. Thanks to his remarkable persistence, the event went on for almost two decades and left a fingerprint in the scientific community, not only in Cuba but in a wider Latin American context.    His leadership allowed for a durable and fruitful relationship between both Math departments at Concordia and Havana universities , along all these years.\nHe fell in love with the city of Havana and its people, and was consequent with this feeling over his entire life. There, he left behind numerous friends and colleagues, well aware of his limitless generosity, sense of solidarity and contagious laugh.\nPablo Olivares\nAssociate Professor, Department of Mathematics\nRyerson University\nFebruary 18, 2016\nThere is nothing not to like about Professor Ali.\nI first met him in Malaysia, during his first visit as an invited speaker to our Expository Quantum Lecture Series in 2007 (EQuaLS1) with the theme of Geometry, Number Theory and Quantum Physics 2007. He for sure was among the expert in the field of quantization theory. The event was organized by INSPEM, University Putra Malaysia. During his visit, I approached him discussing whether I can further my Ph.D under his supervision. He agreed and through his help and justification mentioning Montreal is among the best place to study mathematical physics, I managed to get a government scholarship starting early September 2008.\nDays in Montreal have never been so difficult for us. Despite being an expert in his field, he was so humble in nature. He has been very helpful with almost everything since the early day we arrived. His friends are all over and through him, my other half has had this opportunity to make contacts with the engineering department of Concordia and until now remain in good relationship. Our almost five years in Montreal have been so fruitful. Thanks to him.\nAfter I finished in 2014, we remained to be in good contacts and he has supported our EQuaLS series continuously. Therefore, his recent visit to Malaysia (EQuaLS8) was the most unforgettable memory since it didn't occur to me that it was going to be his last visit. He has contributed much to our institute, INSPEM through his ideas, suggestions and a lot more. Most of us here in Malaysia will never forget Prof. Ali and he has become part of our big 'family' here in the institute. Professor Ali will definitely be missed.\nMy deepest condolences, to his wife and family.\nNurisya Mohd Shah\nSenior Lecturer, Department of Physics\nUniversity Putra Malaysia\nFebruary 8, 2016\nI was postdoctoral fellow at CRM on October 1999.  I think it must have been early November, and an elegant sir apparently of Indian origin (I did not know at the time he was from Bangladesh) knocked at the ajar door of my office and introduced himself to me in Italian, with the typical regional accent of Trieste.\nThat was a surreal moment!\nOver the past 16 years he has been a continuous presence in personal and professional life; his then PhD student Anna, became my wife and Twareque was present at my wedding in Poland (and he danced too!)\nHis office is just two doors down the corridor: his endearing laughter still echoes in my ear when I sit in my office. His wide interests and education made his company fantastically pleasant and never obtrusive.\nI have very fond memories of Twareque, in particular those associated to the conferences we attended together, several times, in Bialowieza and Havana.\nHis untimely passing leaves all of us disconcerted.\nMy wife Anna, my Parents Daria and Pino and myself are deeply saddened by his passing and wish to extend our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel and his family.  \nMarco Bertola\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 3, 2016\nI knew Twareque since he began his career at Concordia.  He was special and unique in so many ways.  Academically, he was very well established as an expert in mathematical physics and had professional contacts literally in every corner of the world.  I don’t know anyone else who traveled as extensively as he did to give invited talks, or to participate in conferences, or official exchange programs between Concordia and other universities that were created through his initiative, such as the annual one between Concordia and the University of Havana and another one with the University of Bialystok, Poland.\nTwareque was one of the most broadly educated people I have known.  Besides his own areas of expertise in mathematical physics, he was familiar with philosophy, history, literature and poetry. He spoke six or seven languages, and was quite at home in most of the countries he visited. \nHe was an excellent teacher who also taught in the Science College from time to time and the students there greatly appreciated the way he introduced them to genuine mathematical thinking.  He had a terrific sense of humour and an endless supply of stories and anecdotes.  I chatted with him over a cup of coffee just a few days before he left for Malaysia and feel a very profound sense of loss.  We will all miss his stories, his laughter, his wisdom and his expertise.\nHal Proppe\nProfessor, Dept. of Math & Stats\nConcordia University\nFebruary 2, 2016\nTwareque is one of the most outstanding men I have known. A man of great culture and modesty.\nI am friends with Twareque since 1998. I had the chance to meet him thanks to one of the many academic responsibilities he had, both within and outside the university, such as member of the Graduate Committee of the Mathematics and Statistics Department at Concordia University, 1999-2002; member of a special committee appointed by the Dean to study the future of the Department of Physics and that recommended measures to restructure it, 2000-2001; he was a member of the Organizing Committee of the XI to the XXVI Colloquia on Geometric Methods in Physics, developed in Bialowieza, Poland, from 1992 to 2007; Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of Montreal, 2003-2006; member of the Organizing Committee and founder of I to XVIII Workshops held in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Havana; he helped the development of international scientific cooperation between the University of Havana, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Center for International Academic Cooperation at Concordia University. In particular, Twareque's contribution to the scientific development of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer at University of Havana was outstanding, since 1998 when he began collaborating with the Faculty, encouraging the participation of its members in research and in the development of the research on Wavelets and its various applications, including in Physics.\nAnother of Twareque's contributions was the organization of an annual workshop of international importance to promote the participation of - and exchange with - young faculty members, which gave much added vitality to the event. Twareque showed a great capacity to help the University of Havana and in particular, the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, by donations of computer equipment for the Faculty and through his efforts in bringing international experts to exchange experiences with the Cuban mathematical community and to deliver specialized courses. In 2009, in recognition for his service and efforts, the University of Havana awarded Twareque the special title of Invited Professor.\nHe was a man of extreme human sensitivity. Special friend of my family. We regret the loss of a great friend and a great man of science. I wish to express my condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel.\nReinaldo Rodriguez\n"}

Chaikelson , a professor in the  Department of Psychology , and  Barry Frank , a professor in the  Department of Physics , were just one year behind, at 50 years of service.\n“After so many years the sense of bond we have with each other is strong,” said Shepard, before outlining Concordia’s  strategic directions .\n“Maybe we met a mate here, sent our children to university here, and made deep connections. Concordia is ultimately about people, not buildings … As retirees, you’re still ambassadors, so please continue to spread the word about Concordia and the new strategic directions that make us a next-generation university.”\nRepresenting the honourees, Eric Goldner, a manager of  Student Recruitment , took the microphone to discuss his experience growing up with a father who worked as a counsellor at Concordia.\nGoldner Jr. went on to contribute his own 25 years of service, and counting.\n“Now, as a student recruiter, when I tell prospective students and their parents about our long-term service, it resonates well,” said Goldner, who has held seven jobs in seven different departments across campus.\n“Each of us plays a part, and it wouldn’t be the same without your contribution and commitment to the evolution of Concordia.”\nPeter Shizgal, 40 years at Concordia. \"It's gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.\"\nCheryl Williams, a retired department assistant from the  Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema , was among the honourees. Over the years, she has enjoyed following the careers of graduates, including feature film director Christian Duguay and animator Chris Hinton.\n“Sometimes, it felt like I had 300 kids,” laughed Williams, who served for 30 years.\n“The animators and film studies students are quiet, while the film production students are more outgoing. I’ll miss them all.”\nAnother honouree, Peter Shizgal , a professor of psychology, is celebrating 40 years of service. Like Williams, he enjoys the collegial nature of his department.\n“The department was on the rise when I started, and my area — behavioural neurobiology — really took off,” he said. “It’s gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.”\nShizgal has no plans to retire. He will continue to focus his research on reward and decision making. “I have a grant that doesn’t run out until 2018, and I’ve applied to renew a grant that I’ve had since 1976. It would provide funding until 2021.”\nVenkat Ramachandran, 45 years at Concordia. \"I'm proud to have been a part of that.\"\nVenkat Ramachandran , a professor from the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , is celebrating 45 years at Concordia. His son followed his footsteps, studying electrical engineering at Concordia, and now teaches at Rowan University in New Jersey.\n“The department expanded and made a name for itself,” said Ramachandran, who has 21 academic awards in research, teaching, administration and engineering education.\n“I’m proud to have been a part of that.”\nRead more about  Concordia staff who were honoured  in 2015.\n \n"}

She was 19 years old.\n“My colleagues were approaching me to give me work and I wondered why they were not addressing me by my name, Alfonsina,” recounts Plenzich. “I soon figured out that, like in my childhood, they were having a hard time pronouncing my name. So I said, ‘By the way, you can call me Alfie.’”\nAlfie Plenzich\nPlenzich — who still goes by Alfie — says their reaction was one of relief. She says her years at Concordia have been full of funny stories, friendships and learning.\n“You know when you're a child and you’re growing up, and your mother and father teach you? Well, Concordia became that to me,” says Plenzich. “I was a child from an immigrant family. In my area, I was surrounded by Italian people. When I came here it was all kinds of people. The best part was the knowledge, the surroundings and my co-workers, some of whom are now part of my life.”\nOne of those people is her husband, Alan Gingell, who works in the Mail Services division of Facilities Management. They met in 1992 at a university event.\nDuring her four decades at Concordia, Plenzich has worked for Financial Services , which handled payroll before it came under the umbrella of Human Resources , as well as for the Faculty of Arts and Science as a budget officer. \nToday, she is a payroll administrator with Human Resources. For the calendar year Plenzich works on income taxes, and for the fiscal year, balance-sheet accounts. She also serves as a resource person for her colleagues and the university community.\nOver the years, Plenzich has experienced first-hand the integration of new technologies and watched the university transform.\n“Everything we did was by hand. Then one day they decided they were going to put this foreign thing on my desk called a computer,” says Plenzich with a laugh. “Now I cannot live without a computer, iPad or iPhone.”\nPlenzich says her career at Concordia has allowed her to grow, learn and become the person she is today.\n“I still enjoy my job and I love Concordia.”\nFred Szabo: steadfast teacher and former dean\nProfessor of Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics\n50 years at Concordia\nFred Szabo started his teaching career at Sir George Williams University in the fall of 1964.\nOver half a century later, Szabo is a full professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\n“Concordia allowed me to fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher,” says Szabo, who specializes in the computer-assisted teaching of mathematics.\nFred Szabo\nIn 1986, Szabo took on the role of dean of Graduate Studies, and supervised the establishment of many new graduate degrees, including the PhD in Biology, PhD in Mathematics, MSc in Administration and MSc in Aerospace Engineering.\n“I fought tooth and nail for Concordia to create graduate programs at a time when this was really a big deal,” says Szabo. “These things are now taken for granted. In the late ’80s they required finesse, tact and inspiring collaboration.”\nAfter Szabo's term, the Senate approved the establishment of a School of Graduate Studies.\nIn ’92 Szabo hung up his dean’s hat and went back to teaching, which has kept him busy for the last 22 years. During this time, he pioneered online mathematics education.\n“One of the gratifying aspects of my 51 years of teaching at Concordia is the fact that some colleagues still often greet me as ‘Dean Szabo.’”\n“I must have done something right,” he adds.\nA lasting tribute to Szabo’s work, inspiration and vision is his brainchild, the Prix d’excellence of the Association des doyens des études supérieures au Québec (ADESAQ), which recognizes the best PhD thesis written at one of the four universities in Montreal in a given year.\n“There is always lots of work to be done and lots of opportunities to do it. Where others see obstacles, I see opportunities.”\nThe Long Service and Retirees Luncheon takes place today, December 10, 2015.\n \n"}

If current trends continue, that number will increase to 70 million by 2025, according to the World Heath Organization .\nIt’s not just genes that are the cause: socio-demographic and environmental elements are also contributing factors. Lower socio-economic status, living in neighbourhoods that aren’t walkable and poor access to fresh fruits and vegetables can all increase the risk of being overweight.\nWith obesity rates on the rise, a team of Montreal-based researchers embarked on a study to find out how parenting styles and the broader social environment combine to affect children's obesity risk.\n“We thought that certain types of parenting would be associated with a higher risk of childhood obesity, and that the strength of this association would differ between children living in poverty and those who aren’t,” says Lisa Kakinami , the study’s lead author and an assistant professor in Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics in collaboration with the PERFORM Centre.\nThe study, published in Preventive Medicine, suggests that both poverty and parenting style are important predictors of childhood health. “Successful strategies to combat childhood obesity need to reflect these independent and interactive associations on health,” Kakinami says.\nShe and her research team* used data from a national survey of Canadian youth, carried out by Statistics Canada from 1994 to 2008. They examined information on 37,577 children and compared socio-demographic and socio-economic status, family and neighbourhood characteristics, and height and weight.\nThe researchers also paid particular attention to the types of parenting being reported, and divided those styles into four groups:\nAuthoritative — both responsive and demanding\nAuthoritarian — not responsive but demanding\nPermissive — responsive but not demanding\nNegligent — neither responsive nor demanding\n \nResults showed that, for the population as a whole, preschool- and school-age children with authoritarian parents were 35 per cent and 41 per cent more likely to be obese than those with authoritative parents.\nBut household income had an effect for the younger, preschool-age cohort. Among kids living in poverty (i.e., living below the low-income cut-offs established by Statistics Canada), the risk of being obese was 20% greater compared with the risk among kids not living in poverty, and this risk was regardless of parenting style. However, among kids not living in poverty, authoritarian and negligent parenting was associated with 44 per cent and 26 per cent increased likelihood of obesity, respectively.\nKakinami speculates that this could be linked to kids’ ability to self-regulate their energy intake. “Authoritarian parenting may translate to parents not responding to children's cues of hunger and/or feeling full, and demanding or controlling the child's energy intake,” she says.\n“That results in the children's ability to regulate their own energy intake being underdeveloped. These children may be more likely to overindulge when given the opportunity.”\n*Partners in research: This study was supported in part by the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Santé. Study co-authors were Tracie Barnett (Université de Québec à Laval), Louise Séguin (Université de Montréal) and Gilles Paradis (McGill University).\n \nFind out more about research in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics .\n \n"}

He just works hard.\n“It comes down to time management, but you have to be balanced,” says the third-year actuarial mathematics and finance student in Concordia's Department of Mathematics and Statistics and a member of the Institute for Co-operative Education .\n“Get involved. Volunteer. There’s no secret, you just have to put the work in.”\nOn November 7, Azzoparde was awarded the Bourse Gilles Joncas, given to the top co-op student in Quebec by the Association canadienne de l’enseignement cooperative (ACDEC), Quebec branch.\nThe honour recognizes a student’s academic achievements, performance during work terms, participation in extra-curricular activities and volunteer contributions.\nAzzoparde’s work-term supervisors have nominated him twice for the Co-op Employer’s Choice award, and he was one of only 46 actuarial students in the world selected to attend the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA) international student conference in Chicago this past August.\nBy the time Azzoparde officially graduates in spring 2016, he’ll have completed three internships in three different departments — retirement consulting, health and group benefits consulting, and investment consulting — at the Montreal branch of Towers Watson, an American global professional services firm.\n“Jason impressed us with his high level of maturity, his motivation, his technical capabilities and his ability to learn quickly,” says Marie-Pier Otis, Azzoparde’s supervisor from Towers Watson during his work term last winter.\nGerry Hughes, director of the Institute of Co-operative Education at Concordia, says Azzoparde was a highly recommended candidate for this bursary, along with two other Concordia Co-op students: “He has an incredible balance in that he wants to succeed, he has the drive to succeed, and he always treats people in a respectful manner.”\nAzzoparde says the fast-paced, stimulating working environment has allowed him to learn a lot in a short time, setting him up well for when he finishes school.\n“Each team offers something different, which is good for any student hungry to learn. It allows me to see many different aspects of the actuarial industry, so I can decide what track to take upon graduation.”\nFinding balance\nAlthough he has just added a major provincial prize to his resumé, Azzoparde says the accomplishment he’s most proud of so far is passing five professional, actuarial exams while balancing his busy schedule, maintaining a high GPA, and earning strong reviews from his work-term supervisors.\n“Sports gave me a balance to the stress of performing academically,” says Azzoparde. | Photo by Tiffany Azzoparde\nEvery morning during his work terms, Azzoparde would arrive at the office early to study. The hard work has paid off and he’s already managed to pass more actuarial exams than most students he spoke to at the SOA conference last summer.\nRanked in the top 15 per cent of his academic program, Azzoparde is also a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society and played two seasons with the Concordia Stingers football team.\nIt’s unusual for a Co-op student to become a member of a varsity team at Concordia, due to the time commitments required. But Azzoparde’s exceptional work ethic earned him a spot on the squad.\n“Sports gave me a balance to the stress of performing academically,” he says. “It was a passion for me. My mind was off my studies and it helped in the long run.” After two seasons, Azzoparde was forced to leave the team this year to participate in a work term.\nIn spite of everything he’s achieved so far, Azzoparde remains modest, saying he didn’t expect to be selected for the Gilles Joncas Bursary.\n“It was an unbelievable feeling. I don’t go through life expecting things. I treat every achievement like it’s my first, and I don’t take anything for granted.”\nOne thing Azzoparde shouldn’t have to worry about when he graduates from Concordia is finding a job. However, he does want to make sure that whatever he ends up doing is meaningful. “I really want to make a difference in whichever role I assume in life,” he says.\nWith his resumé, the sky’s the limit.\nRead the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada’s  press release  about the employability of co-op and internship students.\n \n"}

This past year alone, he taught nine.\nDavis, who earned a PhD from McGill University in 2004, is an expert in the field of electromagnetic engineering. He's sometimes hired as a consultant by medical, biomedical or telecommunications companies. While the contracts are lucrative, he says he’d rather be in the classroom.\n“You don’t teach for the money; you teach because it’s a calling,” Davis says. “As long as it fits with your life, and you feel that you’re making a positive impact on other people’s lives, you do it. When you stop feeling that, it’s time to ask yourself, ‘Is there something wrong with what I’m doing? Has the environment changed?’ You have to adapt.”\nAdapting is the cornerstone of Davis’s teaching practice. The veteran instructor, who earned an ENCS Teaching Excellence Award last year, strives to align his curricula with the current demands of industry, and challenges his students to solve the sorts of problems they might encounter in the workplace.\n“Companies don’t hire an engineer because they already have all the answers,” he says. “An engineer is something who’s in the tool shed of a lot of companies, and they’re called on when there’s a problem.”\nWith the goal of creating a dynamic, interactive learning environment, Davis always includes ample time for questions and discussion in his classes.\n“The really skilled students have already read the book; they already know what I have to say,” he says. “What they’re in class for is to fill in the gaps. It’s really during the interaction that the learning occurs.”\nFor Davis, the ideal classroom is one in which the learning flows both ways. “It’s not my great knowledge being shared with the world so much as it is my understanding blending with their understanding,” he says.\n“Sometimes the students’ questions, or my answers, are actually developing a new type of understanding. That’s the whole point of this.”\n \nChristine Que: An unexpected career path \n“Growing up, I always said that teaching was a job I’d never do,” says Christine Que, a part-time faculty member in the Centre for Engineering in Society. “I didn’t like having the attention on me. Speaking in front of people was a kind of torture.”\nThanks to Que’s passion for languages, though, that changed. After a few years of working as an accountant, she left her hometown of Vancouver for Quebec City, where she studied French at Université Laval.\n“I needed a part-time job, and my French wasn’t good enough to get any other kind of job,” she says. “The one I did manage to get was teaching French at a private language school.”\nHer first class was daunting, but Que quickly got over her shyness and developed a love of teaching languages. “I enjoy the interaction I have with my students, particularly in the smaller classes, where I get to know each of them,” she says. “It helps to motivate them when they know that they’re not just a face in the crowd.”\nQue later came to Concordia to pursue a certificate in Teaching English as Second Language. She followed that up with a master’s in applied linguistics. As a graduate student, she taught two English as a Second Language courses for the Department of Education.\nAfter graduating, Que was offered a part-time job teaching Technical Writing and Research Methods for Engineers and Computer Scientists, a required class for master’s students in those disciplines who need to improve their English-language proficiency before graduating.\nThe course was a major challenge for Que. “There I was, facing 30 students, and I had no engineering background. It was a high learning curve!”\nShe soon adapted, though, and now teaches the course regularly.\n“I like the class because the students really seem to appreciate what you’re doing for them,” she says. “They’re a nice bunch who are curious to learn.”\nWith her limited seniority, Que can only teach two courses a year at Concordia for now, but she also picks up language classes at McGill University and Collège de Maisonneuve.\n“I have a pretty busy schedule between the three places, and I’m never bored,” Que says. “There’s so much to learn.”\n \nPierre Gauthier: “I want to be here as long as I can keep contributing.” | Photo courtesy Pierre Gauthier\nPierre Gauthier: A focus on real-world knowledge \nNext year will mark Pierre Gauthier’s 30th as a part-time instructor at Concordia. He hopes he’ll be at the university for 30 more.\n“I often joke that they’re going to have to kick me out of here,” he says.\nGauthier, PhD 96, began teaching at Concordia at 22, as a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. “I’ve been teaching like a madman ever since,” he says.\nBut that’s not all he’s been doing. For the last 25 years, Gauthier has also held down a full-time engineering job. He now works for Rolls-Royce Canada Ltd. As team lead for the company’s combustion numerical methods group, Gauthier is in charge of the mathematical models that analyze the combustion systems of jet engines used as stationary power plants.\n“I’m very lucky because I’ve got a foot in both worlds, and the two worlds communicate with each other,” he says. “Everything I do at work, I get to teach it here at Concordia.”\nStraddling the professional and academic spheres allows Gauthier to point to the real-life applications of what he’s teaching. That’s a touch his students appreciate.\n“The age-old question is, ‘When will I ever use this?’ Well, I can tell them, ‘I used it this morning.’ Then they pay attention,” he says. “I even bring in parts of engines, sometimes, and say, ‘The stuff we’re doing today may seem abstract, but we actually use it to figure out something specific inside the engine.’”\nTeaching also allows Gauthier to sharpen his own engineering and mathematical knowledge base. “It’s like going to the gym every day, in terms of keeping me on top of what I do at work,” he says.\nGauthier recently became an affiliate associate professor, allowing him to supervise graduate students and run his own research projects with them — something he had already been doing at work.\n“I’m a proud Concordia graduate, so I try and bring as many Concordia students as I can into Rolls-Royce to do internships and summer work terms,” he says.\nAlthough most of Gauthier’s courses draw on his mathematics and engineering expertise, he also teaches a course at the School of Extended Learning that provides struggling students with practical tools for success. “When I teach this course, I feel I’m really making a difference because I can see a change in them from the beginning to the end of the term.”\nAfter almost 30 years, Gauthier is committed as ever to his part-time job at Concordia.\n“I want to be here as long as I can keep contributing,” he says. “I have a lot of fun doing it.”\n"}

Argue with me!”\nTen years after completing her BA in psychology at Concordia, Tremblay returned to pursue a certificate in family education. The program director encouraged her to complete a second BA in applied human sciences instead. During an elective course in sociology, a light went on.\n“I just thought, ‘Okay. This is it,’” Tremblay recalls. “Sociology was the missing piece! I thought, ‘How can I understand the individual without understanding the social context?’ I needed to know more.”\nIn 2001, Tremblay completed her MA in sociology from Concordia, and a year later landed her first teaching job at the university. “I taught a 200-level course called Social Problems. I was a nervous wreck,” she admits.\nShe need not have worried. An avid reader and social theorist with a strong interest in inequality, deviance and social movements, Tremblay also brought years of experience as a volunteer with indigenous women and sex workers to her teaching practice.\nSociology instructor Francine Tremblay says her work experience, including volunteering with indigenous women and sex workers, “keeps my theory grounded.”\n“I like to have one foot in academia and one foot in the real world,” she says. “It keeps my theory grounded.”\nRecently, Tremblay was appointed chair of External Relations for the Concordia University Part-time Faculty Association (CUPFA). She is also working on a pilot research project aimed at assessing student engagement at Concordia, supported by a $4,000 grant from CUPFA.\nCommunity activism, a union role and academic research: it’s all part of being an engaged teacher who strives to create the same restless curiosity in her students. Tremblay says she’s happy to ruffle a few feathers if it means getting her classes really thinking about the issues affecting their society.\n“I want to confuse them sometimes,” she says. “As a matter of fact, it’s in my course evaluations. Apparently I confuse them. Good! I shape citizens. That’s my job.”\nPatrick McDonagh: a man with many hats\nA teacher, freelance writer and avid researcher in the field of disability studies, Patrick McDonagh is not sure what he considers his main gig.\nPatrick McDonagh, a part-time faculty member in the Department of English, is a frequent contributor to Concordia University Magazine.\n“A lot of effort goes into preparing a course. So it seems that when I’m teaching, that’s the main thing,” says the part-time faculty member in Concordia’s Department of English. “That said, I always have a lot of projects going on the freelance side, and I’m also doing a lot of academic research.”\nIn 1998, McDonagh received a PhD in humanities at Concordia for his study of cultural representations of intellectual disability in 19th-century England. A decade later his book, Idiocy: A Cultural History (Liverpool University Press, 2008), was published to critical acclaim. “McDonagh has set a new standard in the history of intellectual disability,” wrote one reviewer from Truman State University.\nCurrently McDonagh is co-editing a collection of essays on the history of ideas of intelligence and intellectual disability, slated for publication next year.\nThe British Columbia native traces his interest in cultural representations of intellectual disability to a summer job he held as a university student working with autistic children.\n“It ended up being quite fascinating — and some years later I also realized that this interest could become a research project,” he says\nIn 1987, before moving to Montreal to pursue his PhD, McDonagh turned his interest into action, co-founding a non-profit agency in Vancouver that provides support services for people with developmental disabilities, autism and acquired brain injuries. The Spectrum Society for Community Living is still active. While McDonagh is no longer involved in day-to-day operations, he remains on its board of directors.\nWhen he first arrived at Concordia as a PhD student, McDonagh immediately sought out work on campus to support himself. With no teaching assistant positions available at that time in his department, he took a job teaching technical writing to engineering students. After earning his PhD, he was offered a part-time position in the Department of English.\nThe job often requires McDonagh to quickly get a handle on weighty texts included in the syllabus for a course he’s never taught before. Yet he enjoys the challenge, and the payoff is that he gets the chance to discuss great works of English literature with his students.\n“I like the preparation, I like digging into it on my own, and the classroom itself is a stimulating environment,” he says. “There are always some good insights that come up — things I wouldn’t have thought of, that I find exciting to hear. It’s not a bad life, talking about literature with a big group of people.”\nRobert Mearns: teaching for the fun of it.\nPart-time faculty member Robert Mearns is celebrating 50 years of teaching mathematics at the high school, CEGEP and university levels. “If I had to do it all over again, I’d do exactly the same thing,” he says. “I guess I’m one of the lucky ones who’s made a career out of something I don’t regard as a job. That’s why I’m still at it.”\nMearns earned a BA and MA from Sir George Williams University, one of Concordia’s founding institutions, and then an MSc in mathematics from Concordia in 1979. After teaching high school in Chateauguay, Que., in the 1960s, he began working at John Abbott College in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Que., when it first opened in 1971. Four years later he took his first job as a part-time instructor teaching night courses in Concordia’s Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\nWorking at Concordia, he says, “was a chance to come down from the milieu where I was, which was kind of homogeneous, and deal with people from all over the world — listen to their stories about why they came here; some of them wanting to go back to their homelands, some not. It was a chance to open up.”\nAlmost 40 years later, Mearns has retired from his full-time role at John Abbott College, but he still teaches 200-level courses mathematics courses at Concordia. “Now I’m doing this just for fun,” he says.\nAnd how does he describe the particular moment that keeps bringing him back to the classroom?\nAfter more than four decades, Robert Mearns is still motivated by the moment his students \"get it.\"\n“When you see a student sitting in front of you with a stern look on their face, as you’re trying to describe something or explain something, and then all of a sudden they crack a smile... You know that they’ve got it,” Mearns says. “That’s a helluva reward for me. That’s what I get out of it.”\nWe’ll be running more part-time faculty profiles over the next few weeks. Stay tuned.\n \n"}

Instead, the assistant professor in the Department of English opted to work these social media tools into her teaching. \"I figured, they want to write? I'll let them write in the way they want on the sites where they want to write,\" says Novakovich. \"The impulse to write using these new tools comes from the students so the practice engages them in a way few lectures could.\"\nNovakovich will be one of a handful of Concordia professors participating in a panel discussion and showcase on how to incorporate social media into course design at the upcoming conference titled e.SCAPE: Knowledge, Teaching, Technology, on April 3, 4 and 5 on the Sir George Williams Campus.\nFred Szabo | Photo by Concordia University\nFred Szabo is among the dozens of Concordia professors sharing his experiences at the conference. The professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics has more than 20 years experience with online teaching and learning. “Technology makes routine computations a breeze,\" says Szabo. \"But online learning also allows my students to turn to the lecture material when they want, as often as they want.\" \nSzabo sees other benefits to online learning, believing it enables greater collaboration between students and frees up class time for greater face-to-face discussion and exploration of material.\nAt e.SCAPE, he’ll deliver two presentations. One is a workshop on how to add interactivity to online courses; the other shows how to use Moodle to manage and improve teaching and learning experiences.\nCourse design will be the focus of another workshop at e.SCAPE featuring two Concordians. Joanne Locke, associate-dean, academic programs in the Faculty of Arts and Science, and Anne Wade, manager and information specialist in the Centre for the Study of Learning and Performance, created an online version of Introduction to Library Research Practices, a course that develops information-literacy skills. The original course, first developed more than 20 years ago, has evolved to teach fundamental research skills to undergraduates throughout the university. A year ago, Locke and Wade collaboratively developed the online version of the course.    \n“Taking the course online opened up information literacy to students looking for greater flexibility in their schedules,” says Wade. “Now, the course content can be delivered in a consistent fashion to students wherever they may be.”\nAnne Wade | Photo by Concordia University.\nLocke also points out, \"Students today are increasingly dependent on web-based resources and online search engines for their research. This shift to teaching online allows students a greater opportunity to sift through these resources, evaluate them, and participate more actively in demonstrations of search applications.\"\nSome professors worry that keeping up with emerging technologies poses a considerable challenge. Yet, it's a challenge many have answered through creativity and innovation. Professors who have integrated technology into their teaching also note that, although not every course can be taught effectively online and not every student learns best that way, they see the merits in these advances to teaching and learning.\nMany students do, too. In the past two years, registration in online courses at Concordia has risen steadily to 11,973 students during fall 2012, compared with 10,921 a year before, and 13,042 this winter, compared with 11,945 in the 2012 winter term. In surveys regarding their satisfaction with the course material, the way it was delivered and the opportunity for interaction with faculty and teaching assistants, 75 per cent of students indicated they are satisfied or very satisfied. \nResearch is being done by Concordia faculty to identify the conditions most favourable to enhancing educational experience through integrating technology. Novakovich, for example, has gone beyond using Twitter and Facebook as writing tools to study the impact multimedia narrative strategies and blogging have had on students’ writing skills. Her research showing blogging’s positive impact on the quality of their writing was recently accepted for publication in the Journal of Educational Technology and Society. Novakovich is currently pursuing a PhD at Concordia in education with a specialization in Educational Technology. \nThe e.SCAPE conference is designed to support Concordia's Academic Plan. The plan's three main priorities for the 2012-13 academic year are innovative and dynamic undergraduate offerings, graduate student recruitment, and investments in the libraries.\ne.SCAPE is scheduled Wednesday, April 3, through Friday, April 5, from 9 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Keynote addresses are scheduled daily at noon. The conference is open to the entire Concordia community: students, staff and faculty. No advance registration is required; admission to sessions is on a first-come, first-served basis.\nRelated links:\n• “e.SCAPE conference: innovation central” — NOW, March 4, 2013 \n• “Meet top brains @ e.SCAPE conference” — NOW, February 27, 2013 \n• “E-learning: New pathways in education” — NOW, February 20, 2013 \nFind an expert\nSearch for an expert to comment on any topic\nEnter a phrase or keyword\nBack to top\n"}

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics undergraduate is not only great with numbers — he’s also got a way with words. An application essay he wrote earned him the inaugural Morneau Shepell Scholarship in Actuarial Mathematics.\nSteven Ma: math and word whiz | Photo by Ryan Blau/PBL Photography\n“I did not think I was going to win, as our class has a lot of competent students,” says Ma. \nThe native Montrealer shouldn’t be that surprised. He received the Golf Classic Entrance Scholarship when he was accepted at Concordia and was on the Dean’s List for 2010-11. He’s also enrolled in the Actuarial Mathematics/Finance Program, jointly offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the John Molson School of Business, which is quite selective: only about 15 students are accepted each year.\n“Steven has a cumulative GPA of 4.11 and he has already passed two professional exams of the Society of Actuaries,” says Yogendra P. Chaubey, chair of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\nThose achievements earned him the Morneau Shepell scholarship award, which was established for second-year actuarial math undergraduates who maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0.\nMa says he loves his program and wants to pursue a career as an actuary. He’s currently deciding whether to work for an insurance company or a consulting firm. The firm that sponsors the scholarship he won, Morneau Shepell Ltd., provides human resource consulting and outsourcing services.\nRelated links:\n"}

Wrong. As millions of students head back to school next week, more than half will use exactly that kind of thinking when faced with fractions for the first time. New research from Concordia University shows that for children to understand math, teachers must constantly make the connection between abstract numbers and tangible examples.\nHelena Osana, associate professor in the Department of Education, and PhD candidate Nicole Pitsolantis put this theory to the test in a classroom of fifth and sixth graders. Their findings — published in the highly regarded journal Teaching Children Mathematics, as well as the British Journal of Educational Psychology — show students understand math much more clearly when teachers use pictures and concrete models to demonstrate what fractions actually mean.\nThose connections are even stronger when the model is personally meaningful to the students. Write out “¾” on the blackboard and the concept is not so clear. Show kids ¾ of a shoelace or talk about running ⅓ of the way to school and suddenly they get it.\nAlthough many teachers already use models when talking about fractions — for instance, a picture of a pie with slices eaten — they often put them away too quickly. To prove that the continuous use of models made a bigger impact, Osana and Pitsolantis tried teaching with models for only part of the lesson, and then for the entire lesson.\nThey found that students showed much greater understanding when the models were present. “Our study shows teachers should not only include pictures and models while teaching fractions, but also have them side by side throughout the class while continually making clear connections between the concepts and the models,” says Osana.\nThe lessons learned from this research project have the potential to go beyond the classroom.\n“This is something not only useful for teachers but also for parents,” says Osana. “Because children are studying fractions, parents think they’re not able to help. But they can have positive effect on learning too. Something as simple as writing ‘¾’ out on a piece of paper, then demonstrating what it means to use ¾ of a cup of sugar, or filling up the gas tank until it reaches the ⅔ mark, then writing and pointing to the numbers ‘⅔,’ can really go a long way towards demystifying math.”\nPitsolantis, who also teaches fourth- and fifth-grade math at Lower Canada College in Montreal, says that the depth of misunderstanding that happens when models are abandoned surprised her. She and Osana are now running tests to determine how teachers can successfully incorporate concrete models into the curriculum for other grades.\nThis research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.\nRelated Links\n"}

To qualify for this coveted certification, the university’s actuarial programs had to meet eight criteria including curriculum, graduate count and quality, and connection to industry.\nJosé Garrido, professor of mathematics and statistics and graduate program director. | Photo: Concordia University\n“We’ve been offering undergraduate actuarial programs for 30 years now, so this is a recognition of the quality of the students we graduate, the graduate education we provide, and the research that is carried out here,” says José Garrido, professor of mathematics and statistics and graduate program director.\nSchools designated as CAEs are eligible to apply for substantial multi–year education and research grants offered by the SOA, adds Garrido. “Every year, it’s harder to get funding because of budget and government cutbacks, and there are very few scholarships available for graduate students, especially if they’re international. So this is very good news, both to support our graduate students – who can apply for extra scholarships they weren’t eligible for before – and to receive research money for faculty members who want to pursue special projects. It’s exciting to have these new sources of funding.”\nEwa Duma, the actuarial mathematics program director, coordinated the CAE application with the SOA. Concordia had applied for CAE status when the program was launched during the 2008-09 school year, but did not meet the faculty size requirement.\n“We hired a new person last summer, so now we’re four professors actively teaching and researching in the program, and that really made all the difference,” says Garrido. “It’s thanks to the commitment of the Faculty of Arts and Science that we’ve been able to grow in a way that we now satisfy all these criteria.”\nAccredited programs are more attractive to prospective students, especially those pursuing graduate studies, because of the additional funding sources, he added. “The SOA has made a tremendous effort to communicate this news about our designation; they sent a press release to all their members worldwide. They are the largest actuarial professional organization in the world. This will also have an impact when we recruit new faculty members.”\nConcordia offers several other programs that have been accredited nationally or internationally:\n• All engineering programs offered by the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.\n• The John Molson School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Its Bachelor of Commerce (Major in Accountancy) Program is accredited by the Certified Management Accountants of Canada National Board of Directors.\n• The Specialization in the Exercise Science/Athletic Therapy program is one of six athletic therapy programs accredited by the Canadian Athletic Therapists Association in Canada and it is the only accredited program in Quebec and Eastern Canada.\n• The Department of Psychology’s clinical training program is accredited by both the Canadian and American psychological associations and by the Ordre des psychologues du Québec.\n• The MA in Creative Arts Therapies, Art Therapy Option, is accredited by the Canadian Art Therapy Association and the American Art Therapy Association.\nRelated links:\n•    SOA announces Concordia’s recognition as Center of Academic Excellence\n•    Faculty of Arts and Science (includes departments of mathmatics and statistics, and actuarial programs, exercise science and psychology)\n"}
