The Department’s programs inspire students with an appreciation of the rich diversity of the living world.\nStudents acquire a comprehensive grounding in modern biology through classroom study as well as extensive hands-on training in research methodology. A variety of specialized laboratories and equipment supports both research and teaching activities.\nPrograms\nThe Biology Department offers Honours and Specialization programs in Biology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and Ecology, as well as Major and Minor programs in Biology. Students planning a career or graduate studies in the biological sciences normally follow the appropriate honours or specialization program. The major program is designed for students who wish to study biology and either obtain a more general education or pursue an additional program in another discipline. The major program can be combined with a major in another department.\nStudents registered in the Honours, Specialization, or Major in Biology may select Biology electives in various subject areas in order to obtain a broad overview of the discipline. However, it is possible for students to pursue in-depth studies in specific areas such as animal biology, plant biology, or microbiology and biotechnology.\nThe minor program can only be taken by students registered in another degree program and provides an opportunity to gain a basic exposure to the main sub-disciplines of Biology or to pursue one such area in some depth.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to take advantage of academic counselling services available in the Biology Department in order to select the program and courses that best meet their needs. Students may transfer among programs after the first year of study since the core courses in all programs are quite similar.\nStudents are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements.\nThe superscript indicates credit value.\nStudents seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in the program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.\n72    BSc Honours in Biology\n27     BIOL 2253, 2263, 2613, 2663, 3673, 4906; CHEM 2213*, 2713\n  3     Chosen from BIOL 3223; CHEM 2123\n12     Chosen from BIOL 2273, 3303, 3373, 3403, 3643, 3663, 3713, 3823, 3853\n30     Chosen from Biology credits** at the 300 and/or 400 levels with at least nine\n         credits at the 400 level\nNOTE: Biology lab requirement: Students must take at least nine credits from Biology courses with lab components (BIOL 227, 330, 337, 340, 368, 382, 450, 466).\nNOTE: Students seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in another program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.

I began a Master’s Degree in 2014 with Dr. Grant E. Brown, where my research focused on studying Neophobia in Trinidadian Guppies.\nI was recently fast-tracked into the PhD program, where I will continue and expand upon my research. The amazing community of students, faculty, and staff at Concordia played a large role in my decision to stay for my PhD.\n In addition to pursuing graduate studies at Concordia, I am also the Science Liaison Officer for the Student Success Center, where I work with Student Learning Services to create and design improved study and tutoring programs for science students.\nThe resources available at Concordia and the wonderful support from both students and faculty have played a huge role in my academic success. I have built friendships and connections that will last a life time.\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo (Department of History):\nI am second-year MA History student. In my thesis, I explore the life and work of fin-de-siècle French literary critic, novelist, and traveller Thérèse (Th.) Bentzon, writing a history of her intellectual life across borders. Using Bentzon’s travelogues about the ‘condition of women’ in the United States and Canada as a starting point, I investigate the link between mobility, the development of feminism, and the making of a modern self in the nineteenth century. \nI came to history by way of journalism, having completed a BA in Journalism and German at Concordia. I was originally drawn to the Master’s program in History because of the groundbreaking work being done at the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.\nThat said, the History Department has given me the invaluable opportunity to explore my research interests in gender and women’s history, histories of empire, travel, global feminism, and autobiography and life writings. My supervisor, Dr. Barbara Lorenzkowski, grounds me in the historical craft while also encouraging me to forge links across disciplinary boundaries.\nPrior to starting graduate studies, my time as a student journalist took me to Istanbul, where I reported on the Gezi Park protests in 2013, and to Munich, where I worked in communications and penned a travel blog in the summer of 2014. As an early-career scholar, I aim to combine the storytelling elements of journalism with the academic rigueur of a historian through her work.\nI hope to pursue my PhD in History, looking at the comparative emergence of feminist ideologies in France and Britain in the nineteenth century, as of Fall 2017.\nRelated topics\n"}

Emphatically so — if you’re biology researcher Grant Brown , that is. On the heels of last week’s discovery of three new species of nearly extinct salamander, the Faculty of Arts and Science professor tells us more about these environmental wizards of the amphibian world.\nWhat makes salamanders so special?\nGrant Brown: Salamanders are particularly interesting because of their trophic position within food webs.  They are prey to a variety of species — birds, mammals and snakes, for example — and are predators on many others, like tadpoles, aquatic invertebrates, some fish and terrestrial invertebrates.\nGiven their role as both predator and prey, they are often used as an indicator of ecosystem health. Anything that disturbs their prey or their predators will be reflected by the salamander population. \nWhy are salamanders particularly good indicators of environmental shifts?\nGB: Salamanders are often considered the “canary in the coal mine” because they are susceptible to small changes in habitat quality. A slight drop in ambient water: they die. A slight increase in acidity in breeding ponds: they die.\nAny animal that has a relatively short life span can be considered an indicator as subtle changes in the environmental quality will be more easily spotted. You can’t wait around to see how small changes affect long-living species.\nWhat's the significance of the discovery of three new species of salamander?\nGB: Describing three new species highlights the importance of preserving natural habitats. Natural and diverse habitat types maintain healthy biodiversity. Losing diversity, especially species that occupy key trophic positions such as salamanders, compromises the population health of all species within the community.\nHow often are new species found?\nGB: With modern molecular phylogenetic tools, new species are described frequently. However, the rate of species loss is more troubling. We are losing them faster than we can describe them!\nHow does your research involve salamanders?\nGB: My collaborative research uses salamanders as model predators and wood frog tadpoles as prey species. We are examining the role ecological uncertainty plays in shaping the cognitive ecology of prey and predators. This is a key “missing piece” in our understanding of ecosystem sustainability, made even more important as climate change, invasive species and habitat degradation are all thought to increase the uncertainty.\nLearn more about research in Concordia’s Department of Biology . \n \n"}

Currently, we are focused on several interconnected research themes:\nMonitoring, modeling and predicting microbial community dynamics. A general goal in microbial ecology is to predict the response of microbial systems to external disturbances, for example, a warming climate. Currently, predictions are hindered by an incomplete understanding of how environmental and biotic factors influence microbial community structure and function. In the Walsh lab, we are using the coastal ocean as a model ecosystem in which to advance microbial ecology towards a predictive science. We are monitoring the composition of microbial assemblages in relation to a long-term, high resolution oceanographic time-series of abiotic and biotic conditions at a temperate coastal ocean observatory. Through repeated observation over multiple years, we are identifying re-occurring patterns in microbial genetic and functional diversity that will inform the construction of ecological models of coastal microbial systems.\nReconciling diversity: organic matter and microbial communities. Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration. Although a natural phenomenon, evidence points to human-driven expansion of hypoxia in both the coastal and open ocean. Oxygen depletion in the open ocean is intensifying, potentially driven by current climate trends. Similarly, excess nutrient input from industrial and agricultural activities are leading to an increase in the number of coastal hypoxic regions. We are investigating the causes and consequences of marine hypoxia from a microbial ecology perspective by studying microbial communities associated with hypoxic bottom waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and several coastal marine basins.\nCauses and consequences of marine hypoxia.\nOxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration.

These courses may be required to strengthen understanding of peripheral areas or of the student’s area of specialization. The additional course work may be assigned as an admission requirement or following the Research Proposal and Qualifying Exam (BIOL 850).\nResidence. The minimum residence requirement is two years (6 terms) of full-time study beyond the master’s degree, or three years (9 terms) of full-time study beyond the bachelor’s degree.\nCourses. To graduate, students must meet the following requirements:\n3 credits from BIOL 616, BIOL 670, BIOL 671 or any of the Advanced Topics or Reading Courses listed at the end of the Biology calendar entry. Other courses in the list may be chosen upon recommendation of the supervisory committee and the Graduate Program Director.\nBIOL 801: Pedagogical training (3 credits). Candidates are required to give four lectures (normally 75 minutes each) to undergraduate classes. Two lectures are in introductory level courses and two in advanced undergraduate courses. Tutorials are provided to introduce students to teaching methods. The course is marked on a pass/fail basis.\nBIOL 802: Research seminar (3 credits). Students are required to give one seminar to the Department based upon their research project. Normally the seminar is given in the second or third years of residency. Seminars are graded on a standard scale (A+ to F). The grade is based upon the presentation, content, and the student’s ability to answer questions. The grade is assigned by the Graduate Program Director in consultation with the candidate’s supervisory committee and other faculty members present at the seminar.\nBIOL 850: Research proposal and qualifying exam (6 credits). The student prepares a written research proposal based upon the research topic chosen for thesis research. The proposal is prepared in consultation with the supervisory committee and contains a literature review, a progress report and a detailed description of future experiments. The proposal should demonstrate a good understanding of the background of the project, the questions to be answered, and the experimental approaches needed to answer these questions. Both the written proposal and an oral summary of the proposal are presented to the examining committee within one year of entry into the PhD program.\nBIOL 890: Research and thesis (75 credits).\nResearch Proposal and Qualifying Exam. The examining committee consists of the student’s supervisory committee plus two additional members of the Department of Biology and is chaired by the Graduate Program Director. The student is evaluated on the basis of the quality of the oral and written presentations of the proposal and on responses to questions from the examining committee. These questions extend into general areas as well as focusing directly on the thesis topic. The examining committee assigns one of the following three grades:\nPASS: The student is admitted to candidacy for a PhD in Biology.\nCONDITIONAL PASS: The student is admitted to candidacy but is required to complete at least one additional course. This grade is assigned only if the background preparation of the student is judged to be insufficient.\nFAIL: The student must withdraw from the program.\nIf the examining committee judges that the proposal has weaknesses that can be corrected with minor revisions, it may suspend assigning a mark for a period not exceeding three months. The revised proposal then is assigned one of the three above grades.\nThesis. A major portion of the PhD program involves the planning and execution of innovative and original research under the direction of a supervisor. It is expected that this research should result in publication in reputable journals, on which the candidate is the first author and the major contributor of ideas and experimental data.

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

This is because every one of the 3 billion or so cells that make up you recycles biomaterials. To do so, they use specialized tiny organs or organelles called lysosomes. Lysosomes are an essential source of nutrients for cells and they breakdown toxic biomaterials that accumulate in cells as they age. As such, progressive loss of lysosome function is thought to contribute to aging and ultimately death. Lysosomes require 3 processes to function: (1) membrane fusion to receive incoming biomaterials, (2) biomaterial catabolism by lumenal hydrolyses, and (3) nutrient transport by transporter proteins that return products of catabolism (amino acids, sugars, lipids) to the cell. My lab studies the molecular underpinnings of lysosome membrane fusion and nutrient transport. We discovered that during membrane fusion, a portion of the lysosome membrane is internalized and catabolized. Lysosomal transporter proteins are selectively sorted into this area and degraded offering lysosomes a mechanism to to clear damaged transporter proteins or remodel themselves when necessary. This process, which we named the \"ILF pathway\" seems to be critical for lysosome function when cells are starved or as they age. As my lab continues to study the contributions of ILF pathway to lysosome biology, I aim to translate state-of-the-art knowledge into new strategies to promote longevity and treat age-related diseases.\nTeaching activities\n"}

To this end we are pursuing research towards discovering and engineering enzyme biocatalysts for the production of anticancer anthracycline glycoside drugs and other therapeutic drugs from the same class of natural products for use in a wide range of health applications.

In one program, we investigate cell cycle control and development in Candida albicans, one of the most common fungal pathogens of humans. C. albicans differentiates into several cell types, including yeast, pseudohyphae or hyphae. This trait is crucial for virulence; cells locked in one form are significantly less pathogenic. Cell cycle signals have profound effects on differentiation and polar morphogenesis in C. albicans, but the basic cell cycle circuitry and mechanisms linking it with development are not well defined. We specifically investigate regulatory aspects of the G1/S transition, mitosis and polar morphogenesis. Our work revealed distinct features that have important implications for new drug target discovery and controlling growth of the pathogen. In a second program, we focus on the roles of a polo-like kinase, PLKA, in cell cycle regulation and development of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Polo-like kinases are multi-functional cell cycle regulators in yeast to humans, up-regulated in many cancers, and play additional roles in metazoan development. We identified PLKA in A. nidulans, which is the only filamentous fungal polo-like kinase characterized to date, and demonstrated that it has many novel functions, including negatively regulating sexual development. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that filamentous fungal polo-like kinases are a distinct group, which has important implications for the evolution of the polo-like kinase family.\nAccepting graduate students: Please forward a C.V. and provide names of references\nTeaching activities\nBiotechnology and Genomics Lab (Diploma Program in Genomics)\nSelected publications\nMogilevsky,  K.*, Glory, A.* and Bachewich, C.  2012.

Microorganisms, in particular fungi, are efficient decomposers of plant biomass. They produce extracellular enzymes to breakdown plant biomass. We use genomic and ancillary approaches to identify novel enzymes involved in lignocellulose hydrolysis. Our research includes: 1) sequencing and analysis of thermophilic fungi and wood-rotting fungi; 2) examine the transcriptome and exo-proteome profiles of these fungi to identify promising lignocellulolytic proteins; 3) produce recombinant proteins using the industrial workhorse Aspergillus niger; 4) determine the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzymes; and 5) in collaboration with industrial and government partners, test the enzymes for industrial and environmental applications. Data management and development of computational tools are integral parts of our research. Other research interests include biocuration, phylogenomics, developmental of sustainable biotechnology and cell differentiation.\nSelected publications\nBadhan A, Jin L, Wang Y, Han S, Kowalczys K, Brown DC, Ayala CJ, Latoszek-Green M, Miki B, Tsang A, McAllister T.

We use an array of genetic and  genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicans functions. As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international  research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome.  We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and  ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have  identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic  pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of the C. albicans cell cycle, and  investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system. We are also screening an  extensive library of conditional C.  albicans mutants using various physiological and chemical treatments  through the functional Genomics robotic facility at Concordia. This will allow  us to explore, tailor, and understand the subtleties that make C. albicans a human pathogen.\nFunding sources\nCIHR, Merck, Canada Research Chairs\nTeaching activities\nBIOL  511/BIOL 4980, Structural Genomics\nBIOL 261, Genetics\nSelected publications\nEpp E, Nazarova E, Regan H, Douglas LM, Konopka JB,Vogel J, Whiteway M.

Limited tolerance to extremes in temperatures, drought, salinity and nutrient imbalances have traditionally restricted the cropping alternatives available to growers and threatened the sustainability of agriculture. Understanding the genetic basis of environmental stress tolerance and genetic improvement of crop species can enhance productivity, expand crop production into previously non-economically viable areas and reduce the need for expensive inputs with possible environmentally damaging consequences. Many plant species show remarkable tolerance to environmental stresses, including high salinity, drought and temperatures below -20°C. The molecular analysis of the plant's response to drought, salt stress, and freezing have shown that there is a large number of genes that are up-regulated in response to these stresses. Some of stress-responsive genes are regulated by common signalling pathways that act in response to different stresses and others are regulated by pathways that are unique to specific stresses. Many of the stress-regulated genes are themselves regulatory genes. We study the adaptation to environmental stress in wheat, Triticum aestivum, one of the most important crops world-wide. We carry out both molecular analysis of stress-regulated genes and genomic analysis of the stress response for large-scale gene discovery. Our current work focuses on signalling pathways that are mediated by the interaction of GTP binding proteins (G proteins), calcium binding proteins and phospholipase C's. These stress regulated genes encoding these proteins initially were discovered in wheat, and in a closely related and highly salt-tolerant wild wheatgrass Lophopyrum elongatum. To further characterize the effects of these genes on plant growth and resistance to environmental stress we characterize the homologs of the cereal genes in Arabidopsis lines in which the genes have been mutated or over-expressed.\nOur second major area of research is in genomic research of wheat and closely related species in the tribe Triticeae. We characterize expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from large-scale first and second generation sequencing of cDNA. Gene discovery is directed toward the identification of signalling and regulatory genes whose expression is induced or repressed by environmental stress and the characterization of homeologous gene expression in polyploidy plants.\nTeaching activities\nMolecular and General Genetics\nSelected publications\nKhalil, H.B., Brunetti, S.C., Pham, U.M., Maret, D., Laroche, A., Gulick, P.J.

In one program, we investigate cell cycle control and development in Candida albicans, one of the most common fungal pathogens of humans. C. albicans differentiates into several cell types, including yeast, pseudohyphae or hyphae. This trait is crucial for virulence; cells locked in one form are significantly less pathogenic. Cell cycle signals have profound effects on differentiation and polar morphogenesis in C. albicans, but the basic cell cycle circuitry and mechanisms linking it with development are not well defined. We specifically investigate regulatory aspects of the G1/S transition, mitosis and polar morphogenesis. Our work revealed distinct features that have important implications for new drug target discovery and controlling growth of the pathogen. In a second program, we focus on the roles of a polo-like kinase, PLKA, in cell cycle regulation and development of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Polo-like kinases are multi-functional cell cycle regulators in yeast to humans, up-regulated in many cancers, and play additional roles in metazoan development. We identified PLKA in A. nidulans, which is the only filamentous fungal polo-like kinase characterized to date, and demonstrated that it has many novel functions, including negatively regulating sexual development. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that filamentous fungal polo-like kinases are a distinct group, which has important implications for the evolution of the polo-like kinase family.\nAccepting graduate students: Please forward a C.V. and provide names of references\nTeaching activities\nBiotechnology and Genomics Lab (Diploma Program in Genomics)\nSelected publications\nMogilevsky,  K.*, Glory, A.* and Bachewich, C.  2012.

This is because every one of the 3 billion or so cells that make up you recycles biomaterials. To do so, they use specialized tiny organs or organelles called lysosomes. Lysosomes are an essential source of nutrients for cells and they breakdown toxic biomaterials that accumulate in cells as they age. As such, progressive loss of lysosome function is thought to contribute to aging and ultimately death. Lysosomes require 3 processes to function: (1) membrane fusion to receive incoming biomaterials, (2) biomaterial catabolism by lumenal hydrolyses, and (3) nutrient transport by transporter proteins that return products of catabolism (amino acids, sugars, lipids) to the cell. My lab studies the molecular underpinnings of lysosome membrane fusion and nutrient transport. We discovered that during membrane fusion, a portion of the lysosome membrane is internalized and catabolized. Lysosomal transporter proteins are selectively sorted into this area and degraded offering lysosomes a mechanism to to clear damaged transporter proteins or remodel themselves when necessary. This process, which we named the \"ILF pathway\" seems to be critical for lysosome function when cells are starved or as they age. As my lab continues to study the contributions of ILF pathway to lysosome biology, I aim to translate state-of-the-art knowledge into new strategies to promote longevity and treat age-related diseases.\nTeaching activities\n"}

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

Limited tolerance to extremes in temperatures, drought, salinity and nutrient imbalances have traditionally restricted the cropping alternatives available to growers and threatened the sustainability of agriculture. Understanding the genetic basis of environmental stress tolerance and genetic improvement of crop species can enhance productivity, expand crop production into previously non-economically viable areas and reduce the need for expensive inputs with possible environmentally damaging consequences. Many plant species show remarkable tolerance to environmental stresses, including high salinity, drought and temperatures below -20°C. The molecular analysis of the plant's response to drought, salt stress, and freezing have shown that there is a large number of genes that are up-regulated in response to these stresses. Some of stress-responsive genes are regulated by common signalling pathways that act in response to different stresses and others are regulated by pathways that are unique to specific stresses. Many of the stress-regulated genes are themselves regulatory genes. We study the adaptation to environmental stress in wheat, Triticum aestivum, one of the most important crops world-wide. We carry out both molecular analysis of stress-regulated genes and genomic analysis of the stress response for large-scale gene discovery. Our current work focuses on signalling pathways that are mediated by the interaction of GTP binding proteins (G proteins), calcium binding proteins and phospholipase C's. These stress regulated genes encoding these proteins initially were discovered in wheat, and in a closely related and highly salt-tolerant wild wheatgrass Lophopyrum elongatum. To further characterize the effects of these genes on plant growth and resistance to environmental stress we characterize the homologs of the cereal genes in Arabidopsis lines in which the genes have been mutated or over-expressed.\nOur second major area of research is in genomic research of wheat and closely related species in the tribe Triticeae. We characterize expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from large-scale first and second generation sequencing of cDNA. Gene discovery is directed toward the identification of signalling and regulatory genes whose expression is induced or repressed by environmental stress and the characterization of homeologous gene expression in polyploidy plants.\nTeaching activities\nMolecular and General Genetics\nSelected publications\nKhalil, H.B., Brunetti, S.C., Pham, U.M., Maret, D., Laroche, A., Gulick, P.J.

This includes an in depth molecular analysis of anillin, a conserved actin and myosin binding protein that is a key component of the contractile ring required for cytokinesis. A future goal will be the identification of novel  regulators of actin-myosin assembly and contraction in nonmuscle cells.

The aims of my research are focused upon using techniques in synthetic biology as a means of exploiting enzymes, developing them as tools in industrial biocatalysis, as well as targeting them within pathogenic microbes to disable them with specific inhibitor drugs as therapeutics to treat infectious diseases.\nEnzyme engineering\nUsing techniques like directed evolution, we can engineer enzymes to optimize them towards our desired activities by mimicking the natural selection process in the laboratory. To this end we are pursuing research towards discovering and engineering enzyme biocatalysts for the production of anticancer anthracycline glycoside drugs and other therapeutic drugs from the same class of natural products for use in a wide range of health applications. We also aim to establish, using synthetic biology, new methods for producing biorenewable hydrocarbons as alternatives to petroleum products and to engineer, through directed evolution, efficient enzyme biocatalysts for doing so.\nScreening enzyme inhibitors as antimicrobial drugs\nWe aim to develop and apply high-throughput enzyme activity-based methods for discovering drugs against Mycobacteria tuberculosis using an in vitro reconstituted biosynthetic pathway of mycobacterial cell wall components by which to assay enzyme inhibitors.\nOpportunities\nStudents interested in research positions in our lab, please email a C.V. and provide the names and contact information of references\nPublications\nKwan, D.H., Jin, Y., Jiang, J., Chen, H.M., Kötzler, M.P., Overkleeft, H.S., Davies, G.J., and Withers, S.G.

Microorganisms, in particular fungi, are efficient decomposers of plant biomass. They produce extracellular enzymes to breakdown plant biomass. We use genomic and ancillary approaches to identify novel enzymes involved in lignocellulose hydrolysis. Our research includes: 1) sequencing and analysis of thermophilic fungi and wood-rotting fungi; 2) examine the transcriptome and exo-proteome profiles of these fungi to identify promising lignocellulolytic proteins; 3) produce recombinant proteins using the industrial workhorse Aspergillus niger; 4) determine the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzymes; and 5) in collaboration with industrial and government partners, test the enzymes for industrial and environmental applications. Data management and development of computational tools are integral parts of our research. Other research interests include biocuration, phylogenomics, developmental of sustainable biotechnology and cell differentiation.\nSelected publications\nBadhan A, Jin L, Wang Y, Han S, Kowalczys K, Brown DC, Ayala CJ, Latoszek-Green M, Miki B, Tsang A, McAllister T.

First, our laboratory is investigating biochemical and molecular aspects of the sulfonation reaction in relation to plant growth, development and adaptation to stress using Arabidopsis thaliana sulfotransferases as a model system. To date, we have characterized two sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of brassinosteroids and hydroxylated derivatives of jasmonic acid, respectively. The biochemical function and the pattern of expression of these enzymes suggest that plants like mammals use the sulfonation reaction to modulate the biological activity of hormones and chemical messengers. Our second axis of research is the study of the structure function relationship of sulfotransferases in order to elucidate the mechanism of sulfonate transfer and to define the amino acids responsible for substrate binding and catalysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, we mapped several amino acids required for catalysis and cosubstrate binding while the construction of chimeric proteins allowed to define the domain responsible for substrate specificity.\nTeaching activities\n"}

Currently, we are focused on several interconnected research themes:\nMonitoring, modeling and predicting microbial community dynamics. A general goal in microbial ecology is to predict the response of microbial systems to external disturbances, for example, a warming climate. Currently, predictions are hindered by an incomplete understanding of how environmental and biotic factors influence microbial community structure and function. In the Walsh lab, we are using the coastal ocean as a model ecosystem in which to advance microbial ecology towards a predictive science. We are monitoring the composition of microbial assemblages in relation to a long-term, high resolution oceanographic time-series of abiotic and biotic conditions at a temperate coastal ocean observatory. Through repeated observation over multiple years, we are identifying re-occurring patterns in microbial genetic and functional diversity that will inform the construction of ecological models of coastal microbial systems.\nReconciling diversity: organic matter and microbial communities. Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration. Although a natural phenomenon, evidence points to human-driven expansion of hypoxia in both the coastal and open ocean. Oxygen depletion in the open ocean is intensifying, potentially driven by current climate trends. Similarly, excess nutrient input from industrial and agricultural activities are leading to an increase in the number of coastal hypoxic regions. We are investigating the causes and consequences of marine hypoxia from a microbial ecology perspective by studying microbial communities associated with hypoxic bottom waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and several coastal marine basins.\nCauses and consequences of marine hypoxia.\nOxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration.

We use an array of genetic and  genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicans functions. As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international  research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome.  We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and  ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have  identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic  pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of the C. albicans cell cycle, and  investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system. We are also screening an  extensive library of conditional C.  albicans mutants using various physiological and chemical treatments  through the functional Genomics robotic facility at Concordia. This will allow  us to explore, tailor, and understand the subtleties that make C. albicans a human pathogen.\nFunding sources\nCIHR, Merck, Canada Research Chairs\nTeaching activities\nBIOL  511/BIOL 4980, Structural Genomics\nBIOL 261, Genetics\nSelected publications\nEpp E, Nazarova E, Regan H, Douglas LM, Konopka JB,Vogel J, Whiteway M.

At the same time, parasites are organisms in their own right and are subject to many of the same environmental pressures that affect free living organisms. Research in this laboratory is focussed primarily on the trematode (fluke) and cestode (tapeworm) parasites of aquatic birds. Our approach is mainly ecological in it's perspective and involves studies the effects of temporal and spatial parameters on parasite communities in wild ducks, gulls and coots. The most recent study is on the seasonal dynamics of parasites in eider ducks in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. In addition to studies on the parasites in birds, we also work on projects that explore various aspects of parasite life cycles, seasonal dynamics of parasites in snail and arthropod intermediate hosts and on host-parasite relations between parasite larvae and the intermediate hosts. This has included studies on the seasonal transmission of two trematodes (Cyclocoelum and Diplostomum ) in laboratory and natural conditions and aspects of the host parasite -relationship between cestode larvae and crustacean intermediate hosts. Because birds are hosts to a tremendous diversity of parasitic worms, a significant part of the work in this laboratory involves the identification of parasite species. While much of this is done using traditional morphological methods, we also use molecular methods in studies designed to clarify relationships between morphologically similar species, to identify potentially pathogenic parasite larvae and to investigate the phylogenetic history of members of selected families of cyclophyllidean cestodes.\nSelected publications\nDesilets, H.

Prior to this he held his first post doctoral fellowship at the August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), where he also taught in the Department of Cell Biology. He received a PhD in Medical Physiology from Lund University (Sweden) and has a strong background in molecular biology and protein chemistry after studies at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund University (MSc., Chemical Engineering).\nEducation\nPhD (Lund University), MSc (Lund University)\nResearch interests\nThe main research interests in Dr Bergdahl’s lab lies in studies of the blood vessel wall with a focus on understanding this system during physiologically stressful situations like exercise as well as pathophysiological conditions. The differentiation and functional properties of smooth muscle cells depend on the cellular environment, and any disturbance of this, such as endothelial damage, inflammation or lipid retention will lead to reactions that can initiate atherosclerotic lesions. Dr Bergdahl study mechanisms involved in these processes by using state-of-the-art techniques including electrophysiology, isometric force measurements, functional proteomics, molecular genetics and advanced imaging. The overriding goal is to define conditions that are essential for the normal function and cell differentiation in the vascular wall and to translate these findings from the basic understanding and experimental animal research into clinical understanding of integrative cardiovascular control in health and disease.

The main project called \"Hormonal regulation of T cell Genomics.\", is meant to investigate how the catecholamine hormone receptors (e.g. beta2-adrenergic receptor) influence T lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Other hormones of interest include thyroid hormones and cortisol. A second project called \"Human variations in sympathetic nervous system response.\" was recently launched to address the hypothesis that human autonomic traits are distributed around two theoretical groupings. For this project, human subjects listen to dissonant music or undergo cold exposure to induce autonomic reactions. A third initiative is in development to investigate the impact of sodium on T lymphocyte responses in people. Dr. Darlington always encourages students to develop and pursue their own research interests within the themes of immunology and autonomic nervous system. The research happens in Canada at the PERFORM Centre and the Center for Structural and Functional Genomics at the Loyola Campus in NDG, Montreal, Quebec. \nPublications\nSelected publications\n1.      A.

I regularly teach Biochemistry I (CHEM271) and Biochemistry II (CHEM375). Biochemistry I is an introductory course and covers the basics of biochemistry including enzymology, protein structure and metabolism. Biochemistry II covers more of the specific biochemical reactions involved in metabolic pathways. I also teach Discovering Biotechnology (CHEM209) which is an introduction to the world of biotechnology for non-scientists. This course covers topics such as cloning and genetic engineering and includes discussions of the societal and ethical issues that are involved.

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst.\nThorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes.\nWe are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions.\nThe biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution.\nWhy study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.\nRecent publications\nS.

Following postdoctoral training in molecular biology and behavior with Dr. Donald Pfaff at the Rockefeller University (1990-1992), he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University where he is a full professor. Jim was the 1995 recipient of the Frank A. Beach Award from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, and in 1997 was inducted into the International Academy of Sex Research. He received the Frank A. Beach Comparative Psychology Award from the American Psychological Association in 2009, the Sandra Lieblum Lectureship from the International Society for Sexual Medicine in 2011, the Herbert Thomas Award from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2012, the Concordia University Research Award in 2013, and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality in 2014. He was made a fellow (IF) of the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and a Concordia Research Fellow, both in 2013.  Jim serves on the Standards Committee of the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM), on the Board of Directors of ISSWSH, and is the current President-Elect of the International Academy of Sex Research (IASR). Jim is an associate editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine and Sexual Medicine Reviews, section editor for preclinical research and psychophysiology for Current Sexual Health Reports, and serves on the editorial boards of the Behavioral Neuroscience, Hormones and Behavior, and Physiology and Behavior. He is also an associate editor of the APA Handbook of Psychology and Sexuality. At Concordia, Jim serves as Chair of the Human Research Ethics Committee, Vice-Chair of the Animal Research Ethics Committee, and is a Fellow of Concordia’s Science College.  He is cross-appointed in the graduate programs of Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Exercise Science.\nFun fact\nJim’s son Josh (age 12) is an amazing violin and hockey player.\nLab Alumni\nShavindra Dias, MD (Department of Medicine, University of Columbo, Sri Lanka)\nSarah Farrell, PhD (Research Scientist, Department of Physiology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY)\n \nHélène Gelez, PhD (Senior Research Scientist, Pelvipharm SAS, Gif-sur-Yvette, Paris, France)\nPaul Vasey, PhD (Professor, Department of Psychology, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, AB)\nCarol Coopersmith, PhD (Senior Research Associate, Department of Biological Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA)\nFormer Graduate Students\nSherrie Lee Jones, PhD (Behavioral Neuroscience, 2015).

Road effects model for predicting when animal populations are at risk from roads: an interactive model of road avoidance behaviour\n- Click here to start the model -\nRoads and traffic affect animal populations detrimentally in four ways: they decrease habitat amount and quality, enhance mortality due to collisions with vehicles, prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and subdivide animal populations into smaller and more vulnerable fractions. Roads will affect persistence of animal populations differently depending on (1) road avoidance behavior of the animals (i.e., noise avoidance, road surface avoidance, and car avoidance); (2) population sensitivity to the four road effects; (3) road size; and (4) traffic volume. We have created a model based on these population and road characteristics to study the questions: (1) what types of road avoidance behaviors make populations more vulnerable to roads?; (2) what types of roads have the greatest impact on population persistence?; and (3) how much does the impact of roads vary with the relative population sensitivity to the four road effects?\nOur results suggest that, in general, the most vulnerable populations are those with high noise and high road surface avoidance, and secondly, those with high noise avoidance only. Conversely, the least vulnerable populations are those with high car avoidance only, and secondly, high road surface and high car avoidance. Populations with low overall road avoidance and those with high overall road avoidance tend to respond in opposite ways when the sensitivity to the four road effects is varied. The same is true of populations with high road surface avoidance when compared to those with high car and high noise avoidance. The model further predicted that traffic volume has a larger effect than road size on the impact of roads on population persistence. One potential application of our model is to generate predictions for more structured field studies of road avoidance behavior and its influence on persistence of wildlife populations.\nPublished in Jaeger et al.

What are the objectives of environmental science?\nDr. Martin Scheringer and I want to start a critical discussion of this question. Therefore, we investigate the kinds of research questions asked by environmental scientists. To do this, we are taking a closer look at four questions:\nWhat is the lack of knowledge to be addressed by the research?\nWhat is the purpose of the results?\nWhat are the subjects the research is dealing with?\nWhat are the methods chosen for the investigation?\nWe propose that problem-oriented environmental science should strive to find answers to these questions that are different from those offered by ‘classical’ natural sciences.\nThe reason is that in the treatment of environmental problems, there is often a discrepancy between the needs of dicision makers and the results provided by scientific research (what we call the “datadilemma”). To explore how this discrepancy could be reduced, we make a distinction between knowledge-oriented and decision-oriented reduction of complexity. The challenge that today's environmental research is facing is that decision-oriented reduction of complexity should be incorporated in the selection of scientific problems. We use the guiding principle of “reflexive environmental research” and point out how it differs from the guiding principles of “classical scientific research”. Its key elements are: reflection of guiding ideas external to science (e.g., sustainability); addressing explicitly the uncertainty and openness of scientific results and forecasts (including unknown unknowns); transdisciplinarity; the aim of contributing to the solution of complex and controversial real-world problems; adherence to relevant scientific standards.\nYou find more information and you are invited to contribute to the discussion here: www.env-science.ethz.ch\n9.

Over course of the fall semester, students from Concordia University have returned to “the Point” for the third year to continue their community work in Pointe-Saint-Charles. The December 3rd event is open to the public and features exhibitions, research projects, and short performances.\nSchedule for the day\n2pm-3pm: Performances at Share the Warmth (625 rue Fortune)\n3pm-4pm: Curated walk through the neighbourhood\n4pm-5pm: Vernissage at Salon Laurette (1950 rue du Centre)\nEvents are free and all are welcome!\nUnder the banner of The Right to the City, three classes are discovering how learning with the city, and across disciplines, can enrich education while giving back to the community at large. Students in Art History, Theatre, and Art Education return to study in and with “the Point”, a traditionally working-class neighbourhood with a long history of community mobilization. Students have partnered with local organizations including the Atwater Library, the  Pointe-St-Charles YMCA ,  St-Columba House , and  Share the Warmth , among others. The project host is Share the Warmth/Partageons l’espoir, a citizen-led resource founded on the principles of social economy, education as a right, food justice, and community self-determination.\nThis unique platform for community-engaged learning allows Concordia’s students to better understand real issues facing Montrealers. The Right to the City offers an educational opportunity that is unique to Concordia; in learning from one another and with the community, students develop their critical thinking processes alongside their collaboration skills and sense of how to be engaged citizens.\n“We are pleased and grateful to return to Pointe-Saint-Charles for the final year of this project and to have a group of students who have been true ambassadors for Concordia,” says Dr Cynthia Hammond, the project leader. “It has been a pleasure to deepen our partnerships with these vital organizations, and to reconnect with the neighbourhood. Our students’ research and creative work help to show how learning can be reciprocal, a bridge between university and community.”\nThe Right to the City  project was made possible through a Curriculum Innovation grant from Concordia University. Dr Hammond, Associate Professor in Art History, has worked closely with co-instructors, Dr Edward Little, Chair of the Department of Theatre and founder of The Neighbourhood Theatre project, and Dr Kathleen Vaughan, Associate Professor in Art Education. The participants would like to thank  Concordia University , the  Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling ,  Share the Warmth , the  Atwater Library Digital Literacy Program ,  Salon Laurette , and  Sur la Well  for their support of this pedagogical initiative.\nFor more information please check out the  Facebook event page !\nWhere\n"}

Each of these things — along with every other organism on Earth — contains the molecular instructions for life, called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Encoded within this DNA are the directions for traits as diverse as the colour of a person’s eyes, the scent of a rose, and the way in which bacteria propagate to infect a lung cell.\nJust as DNA is found in nearly every living cell, can we imagine a future where even artificial objects encrypt a genetic code? This interactive exhibition presents a critical and somewhat subversive point of view on the world of objects, where the visitor is invited to manipulate distorted interactive objects, or play the role of a scientific investigator called on to discover the interior organs of an object, through hand held scanners and X-Rays.\nExposition :\nADN / La vie future des objets\nMartin Racine\nLe 31 octobre au 9 décembre 2016\nFR\nIssue d’un important projet collaboratif de recherche-création de trois ans subventionné par le FRQSC, cette exposition présente une réflexion sur la vie future des objets basée sur la métaphore d’un laboratoire de recherche spécialisé dans l’étude de l’ADN.\nQu’est-ce qu’un être humain, une rose et une bactérie ont en commun? Ils possèdent, à l’instar de tous les organismes de la Terre, les instructions moléculaires qui régulent la vie : l’ADN ou acide désoxyribonucléique. L’ADN encode les instructions qui déterminent des caractéristiques aussi variées que la couleur des yeux d’une personne, le parfum d’une rose ou le mode de propagation d’une bactérie infectant une cellule du poumon.\nPresque toutes les cellules vivantes contiennent de l’ADN. Pouvons-nous imaginer un avenir où même les objets artificiels auraient un code génétique? Cette exposition interactive propose une vision critique et quelque peu subversive du monde des objets.

They consider visibility and its limitations within an exhibition project that engages a constellation of voices, works and events through the contribution of guests.\nThis project offers responses that would manifest differently were they to be presented elsewhere, were they to have a different address or context. Embracing a process of dialogue between a reduced community of peers and friends, the works are articulated through lived experience. The task of giving an account of oneself calls for unending reframing and updating.\nThe exhibition includes a series of performances by Marie Claire Forté and Alanna Kraaijeveld, screenings of Chantal Akerman and K8 Hardy’s films as well as a reading from writer and poet Catherine Lalonde.\n* The schedule of perfomances and screenings is available on  our website .\nWhere\nRoom LB-165, J.W.

Made in the UK between 1975-1978 while Marshall was teaching at Newcastle Polytechnic, these works reference Bruce Nauman's earlier Lip Sync from 1969, or the early video works of William Wegman. Parallel works Mouth Room and Arcanum illustrate Marshall's debt to feminist video practice and the 'semanalysis' theories of Julia Kristeva, with art as a signifying and re-signifying practice, as conveyed through Marshall's video theory in development at the same time. Retrospectively, Marshall's refrain of '...go through the motions of saying one thing and meaning another...' bespeaks the closet and the possibility of transformation. \"Go Through The Motions\" establishes the conceptual content and visual economy later explored by Marshall's \"Journal of the Plague Year\" and \"Pedagogue\".\n\"Pedagogue\", 1988, 11 min.\n\"Pedagogue\" is a 1988 collaboration between Stuart Marshall, author, playwright and performer Neil Bartlett (b.1958), and students at Newcastle Polytechnic. Marshall and Bartlett conceived Pedagogue as an improvised, agit-prop video to “cock a snook” at the Thatcher government's Section 28, in progress at the time. Section 28 was a repressive, homophobic legislation prohibiting the promotion of homosexual lifestyles that tried to turn the tide on two decades of LGBT political gains. By seeking to expose the absurdity of Section 28 Pedagogue humorously evokes the cultural opposition to regressive homophobic and anti-sex attitudes of the Thatcher's Britain promulgated in the right-wing press during the AIDS crisis. As a contemporary account states this 'deconstructs the two establishment myths that homosexuality can be \"taught\" and is \"infectious,\" thereby returning to pedagogical and pathological ideas of homosexuality, first explored in \"Bright Eyes\". (Quote from Between Imagination and Reality, ICA 1990.)\n\"Bright Eyes\", 1984, 80 min.\n\"Bright Eyes\" was commissioned by and first broadcast on UK television's Channel 4 in December 1984 in the context of a virulently homophobic media response to the emergence of HIV/AIDS. Marshall's innovative and experimental video-essay charts the media depiction of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease within the long durée of homosexual stigmatization and pathologization. For Marshall this entails earlier attempted sexual reform movements, political repression, ongoing censorship and entrapment. As a history of the present \"Bright Eyes\" combines archival material, historical reenactment and agit-prop theatricality with interviews featuring those on the frontline of the UK and US AIDS crisis such as lesbian and gay activists, health workers and people with AIDS. At the time, Marshall's historical, political and cultural analysis, radical image-text juxtapositions and intertextuality broke the mould and demanded an ethical and political response from its viewers. Displaying polemical attitude, artistic flair and intellectual acuity, \"Bright Eyes\" set the tone for AIDS cultural activism and analysis and continues to resonate with ongoing representations of HIV/AIDS and LGBTQI issues.\nProgram 2 — 17h:\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\", 1991. 74 min.\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\" is Marshall's follow-up to Bright Eyes commissioned by and broadcast through dedicated lesbian and gay magazine OUT on UK Television's Channel 4 in August 1991. Documenting the rise of US AIDS activism and the corresponding UK activist scene, Marshall features extensive interviews with members of ACT UP, QUEER NATION, their UK chapters and corresponding UK activist group OutRage! AIDS activist and OutRage co-founder Simon Watney maps out the US and UK scenes, while activist video by ACT UP and OutRage! members and affiliated groups demonstrates the step-change in the cultural and political self-articulation and self-determination of AIDS activism.\n\"Robert Marshall\", 1991, 10 min.\n\"Robert Marshall\", (filmed with the assistance of John Greyson) charts Stuart Marshall's journey to make a video and visit family in Canada. Here Marshall seeks out 8mm film footage of his earlier family life that includes his deceased father Robert, who died in the filmmaker's company during childhood. Marshall's Barthesian narrative is a eulogy to his father, a paean to the power of the moving image, an account of Marshall's alternative medical treatment for AIDS at the same time as offering a poignant reflection on mortality and memory. Influenced by the writings of the women's health movement and Susan Sontag's Illness As Metaphor Marshall states, 'I believe that one should take some control over one's own disease process.' As such, Robert Marshall parallels the work of UK artist Jo Spence, displaying a historically committed, materialist regard for ethical convictions and political content. These works ask who goes before and what comes after us, while remaining indicative of Marshall's singular and unfaded polemical, critical and artistic abilities.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThis retrospective is an event in conjunction with the public lecture:\n\"Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism and the AIDS Crisis:\nLearning in a Public Medium \"\n"}

Once fabrics are produced, garments or “end uses” are described. “End uses” can be developed to create beautiful fashion garments to everyday basic apparel. As a garment becomes mature and the product lifecycle expires, garments can be recycled back into fibres where the cycle is reborn and new concepts are developed.\nArt Hives’ Science Shop presents UrbanBodies : an exploration of what matters in our everyday lives and neighborhoods.

The subsequent objectives were: i) to reduce the initial concentration of carbon, nutrients, and color-forming substances compared to conventional treatment systems, ii) to investigate removal mechanisms in the new system under electric field, iii) to optimize the system by studying the relationship between various operating parameters. To achieve these objectives an innovative compact electro-anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EAnMBR) was designed and its high performance was researched in two operational configurations. In the EAnMBR, physicochemical, biological and electrokinetic processes interacted simultaneously permitting to control the effluent quality and sludge properties. The dark-color molasses-based wastewater containing the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (53,000 mgL-1), total nitrogen (2,300 mgL-1), total phosphorus (150 mgL-1), was selected for this research and submitted to multi-phase studies. The research allowed to define optimal operational conditions leading to removal of carbon, nutrients by 99% and to complete discoloration in the EAnMBR system. The novel system was compared with anaerobic membrane bioreactor showing performance superiority of EAnMBR in respect to COD, sludge volume reduction and filterability by 10%, 54% and 7%, respectively. A separate experimental phase was dedicated to optimize the energy balance in the novel system by the surface response method. The EAnMBR demonstrated outstanding results which make it a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for various applications, e.g. in food, agriculture and defence industries.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nFollowing the June 22, 1940 armistice and the subsequent occupation of northern France by the Germans, the French government left Paris and eventually established itself in the city of Vichy. The name ‘Vichy’ soon came to be used to refer to the regime instigated by Pétain and his ministers. The shortcut was maintained and popularized in the postwar period, to the great displeasure of the Vichyssois, who have long been refusing to incorporate the war into the city’s history. Whereas the Vichy regime is considered one of the most defining historical events of France’s recent past, in the French memorial landscape of the Second World War, the city of Vichy continues to stand out as a non lieu de mémoire.\nThis dissertation investigates the wartime period in Vichy and explores how the population has dealt with the fraught legacy of the Vichy regime from 1944 to the present. My research examines how the interaction between national mythology, specific local concerns, and broader troubling issues have impacted – and often blocked – the formation of a local war memory. In the immediate postwar years, local resisters strove to establish a strong memory of the resistance. At the same time, a powerful victimhood myth emerged in response to the city’s fears of stigmatization and ostracism. The spa tourism’s recovery in the early 1950s marked a significant change in the city’s memorial politics, leading to the memory of the war being pushed into the background, thereby establishing a tradition of silence in Vichy. This, however, does not mean that the memories of the war never resurfaced. They did, especially during the Algerian War. In the 1950s, Vichy’s economy largely depended on colonial spa tourism. Known as the “Capitale d’été de l’Afrique du Nord,” Vichy was indeed a privileged summer destination for thousands of settlers, especially pieds noirs from Algeria. The fear provoked by the prospect of a grave economic crisis in the event that Algeria would become independent led to a rightward shift of the population. This shift provided the ideal environment for a pro-Pétain memory to gather strength in Vichy, beyond Pétain’s traditional extreme right base. While in the 1950s, Pétain’s myth also enjoyed a revival of popularity in France, it declined rapidly, when, following the end of the Algerian War, the extreme right hit historical lows. In Vichy, on the other hand, this counter memory continued to develop in the 1960s. In the post 1970s period, although the local Petainist memory went underground, no other memory has risen to occupy a central place in the local collective remembering of the war, turning the city into a non lieu de mémoire and making it a counter example of what has been happening in many other places across Europe, where the most shameful aspects of the Second World War have been memorialized.\nWhere\nRoom GM 930.48, Guy-De Maisonneuve Building (1550 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMost of the Researchers’ interest is focusing on Bridge Management System (BMS), by its Maintenance, Repair & Rehabilitation (MR&R) segments, while a good practice of bridge management should cover the conceptual design phase of a new bridge. Although conceptual design is one stage of a bridge life whereas there is still limited knowledge on how it should be conducted. Most often engineers’ decisions are based on their past experience and standard solutions, which are affected by the subjectivity. This approach, most probably, does not reflect the effective way to address different problems of consistency in the decision. To design a new bridge, many factors, like the cost and aesthetic behavior, have to be considered due to their ability to affect the final decision. Generally, decision-makers will make their final design and decisions based on those factors in addition to human subjectivity.\nThe objective of this research is to propose a methodology to develop systematic procedures that can help decision-makers select the most appropriate bridge type with its diverse components and to forecast its Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and other characteristics such as the public satisfaction and environment sustainability of the selected bridge type. The proposed methodology integrates a decision support system with a relevant database within an artificial intelligence environment (AI) and bridge information management tools in order to reduce the impact of human subjectivity on the decision taken during the conceptual design stage of bridges life.\nFor this purpose, Machine Learning technique, which is a part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) environment, will be the core of the proposed methodology. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with its back-propagation algorithm is adopted in order to identify the appropriate solution by setting up its engine guidelines. A polynomial regression method will first be integrated in the DSS: 1) to formulate the database in order to establish the needed functions; 2) to define the input values for the ANN; and 3) to verify the intermediate ANN weightiness of the proposed methodology engine based on historic data retrieved from the database. An investigation will be conducted in order to define bridge characteristics and parameters, to be used in the ANN, and that affect the final decision.\nElements of the ANN layers (Engine model) which include: Input, Hidden & output layers, have to be described based on a systematic and standardized process.

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMany industrial systems are nonlinear with “slow” and “fast” dynamics because of the presence of some “parasitic” parameters. These systems are usually labeled as “singularly perturbed” or “multi-time-scale” systems. Singular perturbation theory has been proved to be a useful tool to control and analyze singularly perturbed systems if the full knowledge of the system model parameters is available. However, the accurate and faithful mathematical models of those systems are usually difficult to obtain due to the uncertainties and nonlinearities.\nTo obtain the accurate system models, in this research, a new identification scheme for the discrete time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural network and optimal bounded ellipsoid method is proposed firstly. Compared with other gradient descent based identification schemes, the new identification method proposed in this research can achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain. Later, the optimal bounded ellipsoid based identification method for discrete time systems is extended to the identification of continuous singularly perturbed systems. Subsequently, by adding two additional terms in the weight’s updating laws, a modified identification scheme is proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the identification algorithm during the whole identification process. Lastly, through introducing some filtered variables, a robust neural network training algorithm is proposed for the system identification problem subjected to measurement noises.\nBased on the identification results, the singular perturbation theory is introduced to decompose a high order multi-time-scale system into two low order subsystems – the reduced slow subsystem and the reduced fast subsystem. Then, two controllers are designed for the two subsystems separately. By using the singular perturbation theory, an adaptive controller for a regulation problem is designed in this research firstly. Because the system order is reduced, the adaptive controller proposed in this research has a simpler structure and requires much less computational resources, compared with other conventional controllers. Afterwards, an indirect adaptive controller is proposed for solving the trajectory tracking problem. The stability of both identification and control schemes are analyzed through the Lyapunov approach, and the effectiveness of the identification and control algorithms are demonstrated using simulations and experiments.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nAn effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) technology can play a crucial role in improving the system availability, safety and reliability as well as reducing the risks of catastrophic failures. In this thesis, the robust sensor FDI problem of gas turbine engines is investigated and different novel techniques are developed to address the effects of parameter uncertainties, disturbances as well as process and measurement noise on the performance of FDI strategies. The efficiencies of proposed techniques are investigated through extensive simulation studies for the single spool gas turbine engine that is previously developed and validated using the GSP software. The gas turbine engine health degradation is considered in various forms in this thesis. First, it is considered as a part of the engine dynamics that is estimated off-line and updated periodically for the on-board engine model. Second, it is modeled as the time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty that affects all the system state-space matrices and third as an unknown nonlinear dynamic that is approximated by the use of a dynamic recurrent neural network.\nIn the first part of the thesis, we propose a hybrid Kalman filter (HKF) scheme that consists of a single nonlinear on-board engine model (OBEM) augmented with piecewise linear (PWL) models constituting as the multiple model (MM) based estimators to cover the entire engine operating regime. We have integrated the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based method with our MM-based scheme to estimate the sensor fault severity under various single and concurrent fault scenarios. In order to ensure the reliability of our proposed HKF-based FDI scheme during the engine life cycle, it is assumed that the reference baselines are periodically updated for the OBEM health parameters.\nIn the second part of the thesis, a novel robust sensor FDI strategy using the MM-based approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for mul- tiple PWL models. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibil- ity conditions. The main objective is to propose a robust filter that satisfies the overall performance requirements and is not affected by system perturbations. The requirements include a quadratically stable filter that ensures bounded estimation error variances having predefined values.\nIn the third part of the thesis, a novel hybrid approach is proposed to improve the robustness of FDI scheme with respect to different sources of uncertainties. For this purpose, a dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) is designed to ap- proximate the gas turbine engine uncertainty due to the health degradations. The proposed DRNN is trained offline by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) al- gorithm for an engine with different levels of uncertainty, but with healthy sensors. The convergence of EKF-based DRNN training algorithm is also investigated. Then, the trained DRNN with the fixed parameters and topology is integrated with our online model-based FDI algorithm to approximate the uncertainty terms of the real engine. In this part, the previously proposed HKF and RKF are integrated with the trained DRNN to construct the hybrid FDI structure.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis thesis contributes and provides solutions to the problem of fault diagnosis and estimation from three different perspectives which are i) fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using nonlinear multiple model approach, ii) inversion-based fault estimation in linear systems, and iii) data-driven fault diagnosis and estimation in linear systems. The above contributions have been demonstrated to the gas turbines as one of the most important engineering systems in the power and aerospace industries.\nThe proposed multiple model approach is essentially a hierarchy of nonlinear Kalman filters utilized as detection filters. A nonlinear mathematical model for a gas turbines is developed and verified. The fault vector is defined using the Gas Path Analysis approach. The nonlinear Kalman filters that correspond to the defined single or concurrent fault modes provide the conditional probabilities associated with each fault mode using the Bayes’ law. The current fault mode is then determined based on the maximum probability criteria. The performance of both Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are investigated and compared which demonstrates that the UKF outperforms the EKF for this particular application.\nThe problem of fault estimation is increasingly receiving more attention due to its practical importance. Fault estimation is closely related to the problem of linear systems inversion. This thesis includes two contributions for the stable inversion of non-minimum phase systems. First, a novel methodology is proposed for direct estimation of unknown inputs by using only measurements of either minimum or non-minimum phase systems as well as systems with transmission zeros on the unit circle. A dynamic filter is then identified whose poles coincide with the transmission zeros of the system. A feedback is then introduced to stabilize the above filter dynamics as well as provide an unbiased estimation of the unknown input. The methodology is then applied to the problem of fault estimation and has been shown that the proposed inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of faults. Second, a solution for unbiased reconstruction of general inputs is proposed. It is based on designing an unknown input observer (UIO) that provides unbiased estimation of the minimum phase states of the system. The reconstructed minimum phase states serve then as inputs for reconstruction of the non-minimum phase states. The reconstruction error for non-minimum phase states exponentially decrease as the estimation delay is increased. Therefore, an almost perfect reconstruction can be achieved by selecting the delay to be sufficiently large. The proposed inversion scheme is then applied to the output-tracking control problem.\nAn important practical challenge is the fact that engineers rarely have a detailed and accurate mathematical model of complex engineering systems such as gas turbines. Consequently, one can find a trend towards data-driven approaches in many disciplines, including fault diagnosis. In this thesis, explicit state-space based fault detection, isolation and estimation filters are proposed that are directly identified from only the system input-output (I/O) measurements and through the system Markov parameters. The proposed procedures do not involve a reduction step and do not require identification of the system extended observability matrix or its left null space. Therefore, the performance of the proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the errors in the Markov parameters estimation process. The estimation error dynamics is then derived in terms of the Markov parameters identification errors and directly synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation errors have been effectively compensated for. The proposed data-driven scheme requires the persistently exciting condition for healthy input data which is not practical for certain real life applications and in particular to gas turbine engines. To address this issue, a robust methodology for Markov parameters estimation using frequency response data is developed. Finally, the performance of the proposed data-driven approach is comprehensively evaluated for the fault diagnosis and estimation problems in the gas turbine engines.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

These systems can be reversibly and controllably transformed between several different stable conformations, and will respond to orthogonal stimuli. The synthesis, electronic properties, and switching characteristics of several responsive IIN-containing small molecules will be presented. \n \nBio\nSara Eisler obtained her BSc. from the University of Alberta in 1998.

Kristin is on the board of directors of the  Borneo Orangutan Society Canada , and the author of two books on the philosophy of animal minds.\nAbstract:\nTraditionally, discussions of moral participation – and in particular moral agency – have focused on fully formed human actors. There has been some interest in the development of morality in humans, as well as interest in cultural differences when it comes to moral practices, commitments, and actions. However, until relatively recently there has been little focus on the possibility that nonhuman animals have any role to play in morality, save being the object of moral concern. Moreover, when nonhuman cases are considered as evidence of moral agency or subjecthood, there has been a tendency to focus on higher-order moral behaviors (i.e., those same behaviors that inform our views about human moral agency). If we are to understand the evolution of moral psychology and moral practice, then this relative lack of attention to the practices of other animals and this persistent focus on the moral instead of the normative have been great oversights.\nA biologically responsible way of examining the distribution of moral practice in other animals starts from considering the distribution of normative practice across species. Drawing on the work of psychologists and anthropologists, the normative foundations of morality across humans demonstrates that some animals—chimpanzees and cetaceans in particular—demonstrate many of the moral foundations that indicate the existence of a cognitive modality I call naïve normativity.\nWhere\nRoom 201, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis dissertation analyzes the convoluted process by which Irish nationalists, Irish unionists, and British politicians negotiated Irish self-government in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In December 1909, a modest form of self-government known as home rule within the British Empire for all of Ireland became a practical issue in United Kingdom politics again, after the failure of two previous home rule bills in 1886 and 1893. After a decade that witnessed a world war and a revolution in Ireland, two new Irish polities emerged by June 1922. Northern Ireland, a majority-unionist state comprised of six counties in the province of Ulster, acquired a limited form of home rule within the United Kingdom. Covering the rest of the island, the Irish Free State secured significant control of its domestic affairs as a dominion of the British Empire, though not the complete independence demanded by Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had waged the revolution.\nHow did the main political parties and actors in Britain and Ireland arrive at this settlement, especially as it was so different from how elites had envisioned Irish self-government in 1909? Using archival material and public discourse, this dissertation seeks to answer this question by methodically analyzing the political decisions taken by British and Irish political parties and movements between 1909 and 1922. It challenges historical conceptions that the settlement enacted by the Government of Ireland Act (1920) and the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) was an inevitable evolution in Anglo-Irish relations, that it marks the British government’s recognition of the Irish right to self-determination, or the triumph of Irish democracy. Instead, I argue that the settlement was highly contingent upon prevailing political circumstances, heavily influenced by British interests, and often defied the democratic demands of Irish people, both nationalist and unionist. Partition, the separation of Ireland into two different states, was achieved through the acquiescence of British politicians to the demands of Ulster unionist leaders, without reference to public opinion in any part of Ireland.\nWhere\nRoom H 1001.01, Henry F.

Re-search-for-design is defined as a research activity performed by the designer in order to inform the design process. This study aims to better understand the contribution of research-for-design education, not only as a required activity in the design process, but also as a strategy to develop a vision for sustainable design. This comparative study examined two university design programs, the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí in San Luis Potosí, Mexico. I examined student and teacher accounts of how research is taught in each program. Through a process of comparative analysis, I identified differences in the participating students and educators’ backgrounds and design streams which led to varied perspectives of disciplinary practice. Formal and informal methods of doing research-for-design were identified and linked to accounts of teaching and learning. These practices in the education of research-for-design included intuitive, informal, spontaneous, ludic, innovative, visual, creative, social, and emphatic strategies. Teaching research-for-design demands an effective way to connect students with their entire environment. By doing this, the education of research-for-design will empower students’ understanding of the design process with the potential to promote ethical, sustainable, comprehensive, and integrative design.\nWhere\nRoom EV 2.776, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis thesis collects three articles that explore the construct of reflected appraisal –individuals’ beliefs about how they are seen in the eyes of others. These manuscripts are linked by the overarching question “How do employees manage the bombardment of myriad reflected appraisals in their daily organizational lives?” To address this, the articles examine four workplace manifestations of reflected that are represented by the constructs of perceived supervisor support, organizational support, respect and external prestige (also called image) while considering the referents inherent in each construct (i.e., Co-workers, team members, the employing organization and external stakeholders). The theoretical manuscript (article 1) examines the four reflected appraisals together, asking what contextual and individual factors predict which reflected appraisals employees are more likely to focus on and when. We use employees’ work-roles as the key construct that links these factors together, arguing that self-motives drive individuals to focus on some reflected appraisals under the constraint of accountability and interdependence that are part of the organizational structure. The quantitative manuscript (article 2) examines the concurrent impact of respect and prestige on relational and organizational identification. In a survey of student-athletes from varsity sports teams, we found that the matching principle prevailed: Prestige and respect that are focused on the relationship predicted relational identification while respect and prestige focused on the collective predicted organizational identification. However, prestige was the better predictor of both the relational and organizational foci. The qualitative manuscript (article 3) focuses on organizational image and explores how individuals respond to perceived organizational stigma. I interviewed employees of general contractors during a city-wide scandal in which various audiences marked their organizations as “the enemy” by virtue of their category-membership. I found that interviewees negotiated two images that embodied individuating and de-individuating reflected appraisals of their organization. Furthermore, employees constructed these images using various sources of information that they integrated into their reflected appraisals. Overall, the three articles demonstrate that employees actively engage with a plethora of reflected appraisals from multiple referents in the organizational environment.\nWhere\nRoom MB 12.101, John Molson Building (1450 Guy), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

It does this by engaging current scholarship on “Comedy,” building upon some of its fundamentals, yet showing that the picture we get of “Comedy” in this literature should be supplemented. To this end, the paper explicates Hegel’s claim that the individual is a “negative power,” and then develops a central point in Hegel’s section on “Comedy,” namely, that in comedy abstract universals are put in play and revealed as they are actually made concrete in the lives of individuals. This reveals the pretensions of abstract universals, unmasking the gap between what we might think of a universal, such as honesty, and this universal in it concrete/actual form. It this pretense and gap that Hegel finds comedic.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

Gavin is completing his MA in Philosophy at Concordia.\nAbstract:\nWhat is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia manifests differently in different cultures, according to different modes of understanding. Modern scientific understandings of the disease categorize it as a neurological disorder, primarily biological or genetic in nature, with the experience of the disease manifesting in the ‘split mind(s)’ (schizo- phrēne) of patients. But there is mounting empirical evidence to suggest that biogenetic and neurologically reductive approaches are limited with respect to their treatment outcomes, and – as I argue – specifically alienating to patients. Patients are faced both with social alienation, and a sense of alienation from self – I argue that this is primarily by the disease’s interaction with its cultural and political situatedness, rather than by the manifestation of disease itself. Leaning on Marx and Foucault, I seek to readdress the question of schizophrenic ontology in this essay, motivating for a model that will attenuate the experience of alienation thought symptomatic of schizophrenia by approaching it as dialectical co-production of both biogenetic, and sociocultural factors. The result is to argue for the irreducibility of the experience of vulnerability in future research seeking to open up treatment options for patients with schizophrenia.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

This fact highlights the importance of improving indoor air quality (IAQ) in in areas including sustainable buildings. Among different air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a major part of indoor pollutants. The proven negative impact of these compounds in occupants’ health has motivated researchers to develop different air treatment technologies for the removal of VOCs.\nDevelopment of plasma-based methods, and their remarkable capabilities for VOCs degradation, has motivated designers to employ these methods as indoor air purification. It has been demonstrated that utilizing a dual functional adsorbent/catalyst (DFA/C) in a plasma system can significantly enhance the VOCs removal and energy efficiency of such an air purifier. However, selecting an appropriate DFA/C is a challenge to achieve the best performance in these systems.\nFor the first time, this research attempted to utilize metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as DFA/Cs for a plasma-driven catalytic reactor. Accordingly, three different MOFs, MIL-101 (MIL: Metal institute Lavoisier), MIL-53, and CPM-5 (CPM: Crystalline Porous Material-5), were synthesized through microwave, solvothermal and mechanochemical methods. To test the performance of these DFA/Cs, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was designed and implemented as a non-thermal plasma (NTP) set-up. During preparation and evaluation experiments, different characterization and analytical instruments, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatogram/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS), Ozone monitor, and VOC Photoionization detector (PID), were utilized.\nSeveral adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted to study physical and chemical behaviors of MOFs for the removal of one (1) ppm toluene and isobutanol on MIL-101, MIL-53 and CPM-5. Also, the effect of the presence of 30% relative humidity on the adsorption capacity and oxidation ability of each MOF was investigated. Results showed physisorption of VOCs on all MOFs during the course of adsorption tests. Moreover, the stable structure of the examined MOFs before and after plasma-catalytic reactions indicated a facile regeneration of catalysts. During the plasma-catalytic oxidation of toluene and isobutanol, different organic by-products and ozone were detected either in dry or humid conditions for all MOFs.\nMIL-101 and MIL-53 exhibited much higher adsorption and oxidation ability compared to CPM-5 in most of the experiments. Results demonstrated a higher adsorption capacity and almost the same oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 compared to MIL-53 in dry air. Nevertheless, the negative influence of humidity on adsorption and oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 was more significant than in MIL-53.\nIn conclusion, results demonstrated the potential capacity of MOFs as DFA/Cs in a NTP system.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nA growing number of recalcitrant pollutants of both human health and environmental concern (e.g., pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals) are being introduced to Canadian and global water and wastewater systems at an alarming rate. While conventional water and wastewater treatment technologies are effective at providing clean, usable water, these methods are inadequate for the complete removal of these emerging aquatic contaminants. Unlike naturally occurring aquatic organic compounds, these emerging contaminants must not only be removed from aqueous systems but also degraded to non-toxic constituent compounds. Membrane filtration is currently one of the most effective technologies for water purification, but conventional membranes lack mechanisms for contaminant degradation. Many environmental contaminants are highly susceptible to aggressive oxidative or reductive degradation. This is achievable with electro-filtration along with electro-enhanced oxidation and reduction processes.\nElectrochemical filtration is a promising technology that aims for the efficient removal of persistent contaminants that cannot be effectively eliminated through conventional treatment methods. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and carbon substrates can be employed as filtration media to which a DC potential can be applied for further electrochemical treatment.\nThis study consists of two main objectives: firstly, an investigation of MWNTs and carbon substrates and the use of electrochemical filtration in dead-end filtration systems, and secondly, the application of the same technologies in crossflow filtration systems for the removal and degradation of model persistent organic contaminants. Through the course of the study, MWNTs were employed as filtration media and tested under different surface conditions and solution chemistries with the aim of achieving the most effective elimination of the model persistent organic contaminants.\nIbuprofen and Bisphenol A, two emerging contaminants of concern, have been reported to exist in natural waters, influent, secondary treated effluent of wastewater, and in primary and secondary wastewater sludge. In this study, dead-end electrochemical filtration was investigated as a removal method for these contaminants. This technique has shown promise in the elimination of both of these compounds and the reduction of their overall toxicity. In these dead-end electrochemical filtration experiments, we employed multiwalled carbon nanotubes as both a filtration and electrode material. As well, the stability of MWNTs was studied under different surface and bulk structural conditions.\nCarboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs-COOH) were used with the aim of increasing the filtration efficiency for the removal of carboxylated ibuprofen under different pH and electrolytic conditions. It was found that the presence of oxy-functional groups can increase the functional surface area of MWNTs and increase the filtration capacity in low voltage applications. In high voltage applications, it was found that electrochemical filtration is controlled by bulk electroactive species. Boron doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (BMWNTs) were also studied, with the goal of improving electrical conductivity during bisphenol A electrochemical filtration experiments. It was found that despite previous reports describing the higher oxidative power of doped carbon nanotubes, with the highest reported for BMWNTs, pristine MWNTs and BMWNTs showed similar outcomes in eliminating bisphenol A. The results indicate adequate performance and efficiency of pristine MWNTs in removing bisphenol A. These results demonstrate the dead-end electrochemical filtration as a promising technology for the removal of these emerging contaminants.\nThe removal of ibuprofen and bisphenol A was also investigated by using crossflow electrochemical filtration for individual and equimolar mixture solutions. The aim was, firstly, to investigate electrochemical filtration performance under the horizontal shear flow mechanism in a flat sheet crossflow setup. Large surface area, superconductive MWNT blend buckypaper membranes were used as electrochemical filtration electrodes.\nThe crossflow configuration shows great potential in eliminating these two contaminants in both individual component and mixed solutions from pure and fouling electrolytes. This outcome can mainly be attributed to the crossflow mechanism and can be assigned to the horizontal shear flow, which likely leads to a consistent surface coverage, combined with the greater conductivity of the MWNT blend buckypaper membrane. The long residence time within the membrane likely leads to a significant reduction in toxicity under applied voltage. Our results suggest that the electrochemical filtration technology based on MWNTs has a potential for use as a polishing step for removal of emerging contaminants from natural waters and secondary wastewater effluents.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

Photo: Guy L'Heureux.\nEN\nFor over three decades, the annual undergraduate exhibition has presented works by students in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University. In recent years, the initiative has expanded to include writers from the department of Art History and designers from the department of Design and Computation Arts. Together, a uniquely designed catalogue illustrates the diversity of works and texts that reveal the breadth of talent found within the faculty of fine arts.\nWe are pleased to introduce a new layer to this year’s iteration and are working with performers from Concordia’s department of Contemporary Dance. As such, the growing collaboration has compelled us to come up with a theme to unify the participating disciplines. The thematic of “space” was introduced to encourage thought-provoking concepts that stem from notions of space, which has the potential to be interpreted broadly within various creative practices. For example, there is the space between generations, pictorial space, the space between performer and audience, geographic space, queer space, political space, outer space, to name only a few.\nThe FOFA Gallery salutes the extraordinary work of the artists, writers, designers and dancers proving that cross-disciplinary practice continues to be an engaging approach within the creative process. We also wish to acknowledge the dedicated guidance from professors in all of these departments who have inspired a dynamic illustration of current interests and artistic explorations.\nFaire des espaces\nExposition des étudiants et étudiantes de premier cycle\nDu 16 janvier au 17 février 2017\nFR\nDepuis plus de trente ans, les étudiantes et étudiants de 1er cycle de la Faculté des beaux-arts de l’Université Concordia présentent leurs œuvres dans le cadre d’une exposition annuelle. Ces dernières années, l’initiative s’est enrichie de la contribution de rédacteurs du Département d’histoire de l’art et de designers du Département de design et d’arts numériques. Ensemble, ceux-ci réalisent un catalogue original où œuvres, textes et facture graphique mettent en lumière l’ampleur des talents issus de la faculté.\nC’est avec plaisir que nous ajoutons un nouveau volet à l’édition de cette année grâce à l’apport d’artistes du Département de danse contemporaine. Pour nourrir cette collaboration florissante, nous avons jugé utile de choisir un thème qui unifierait les disciplines participantes. Ainsi, nous avons mis de l’avant le concept d’« espace » afin d’encourager la réflexion sur un sujet se prêtant à une multitude d’interprétations au sein de diverses pratiques créatives. Par exemple, l’espace entre les générations, l’espace pictural, l’espace entre l’artiste et le public, l’espace géographique, l’espace queer, l’espace politique ou l’espace extraterrestre.\nLa Galerie FOFA salue le travail extraordinaire des artistes, rédacteurs, designers et danseurs, qui prouve que le croisement des disciplines demeure une démarche stimulante dans le processus de création. Nous souhaitons enfin remercier les membres du corps professoral des divers départements, dont le soutien dévoué a inspiré cette illustration dynamique des réflexions théoriques et des explorations artistiques de l’heure.\nArtists / Artistes\nLand of Plenty (detail) (2016), Jordan Beaulieu.

Dans sa production artistique, il remet en cause et déconstruit les archétypes d’hier et d’aujourd’hui liés à la représentation du corps.

I began a Master’s Degree in 2014 with Dr. Grant E. Brown, where my research focused on studying Neophobia in Trinidadian Guppies.\nI was recently fast-tracked into the PhD program, where I will continue and expand upon my research. The amazing community of students, faculty, and staff at Concordia played a large role in my decision to stay for my PhD.\n In addition to pursuing graduate studies at Concordia, I am also the Science Liaison Officer for the Student Success Center, where I work with Student Learning Services to create and design improved study and tutoring programs for science students.\nThe resources available at Concordia and the wonderful support from both students and faculty have played a huge role in my academic success. I have built friendships and connections that will last a life time.\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo (Department of History):\nI am second-year MA History student. In my thesis, I explore the life and work of fin-de-siècle French literary critic, novelist, and traveller Thérèse (Th.) Bentzon, writing a history of her intellectual life across borders. Using Bentzon’s travelogues about the ‘condition of women’ in the United States and Canada as a starting point, I investigate the link between mobility, the development of feminism, and the making of a modern self in the nineteenth century. \nI came to history by way of journalism, having completed a BA in Journalism and German at Concordia. I was originally drawn to the Master’s program in History because of the groundbreaking work being done at the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.\nThat said, the History Department has given me the invaluable opportunity to explore my research interests in gender and women’s history, histories of empire, travel, global feminism, and autobiography and life writings. My supervisor, Dr. Barbara Lorenzkowski, grounds me in the historical craft while also encouraging me to forge links across disciplinary boundaries.\nPrior to starting graduate studies, my time as a student journalist took me to Istanbul, where I reported on the Gezi Park protests in 2013, and to Munich, where I worked in communications and penned a travel blog in the summer of 2014. As an early-career scholar, I aim to combine the storytelling elements of journalism with the academic rigueur of a historian through her work.\nI hope to pursue my PhD in History, looking at the comparative emergence of feminist ideologies in France and Britain in the nineteenth century, as of Fall 2017.\nRelated topics\n"}

Emphatically so — if you’re biology researcher Grant Brown , that is. On the heels of last week’s discovery of three new species of nearly extinct salamander, the Faculty of Arts and Science professor tells us more about these environmental wizards of the amphibian world.\nWhat makes salamanders so special?\nGrant Brown: Salamanders are particularly interesting because of their trophic position within food webs.  They are prey to a variety of species — birds, mammals and snakes, for example — and are predators on many others, like tadpoles, aquatic invertebrates, some fish and terrestrial invertebrates.\nGiven their role as both predator and prey, they are often used as an indicator of ecosystem health. Anything that disturbs their prey or their predators will be reflected by the salamander population. \nWhy are salamanders particularly good indicators of environmental shifts?\nGB: Salamanders are often considered the “canary in the coal mine” because they are susceptible to small changes in habitat quality. A slight drop in ambient water: they die. A slight increase in acidity in breeding ponds: they die.\nAny animal that has a relatively short life span can be considered an indicator as subtle changes in the environmental quality will be more easily spotted. You can’t wait around to see how small changes affect long-living species.\nWhat's the significance of the discovery of three new species of salamander?\nGB: Describing three new species highlights the importance of preserving natural habitats. Natural and diverse habitat types maintain healthy biodiversity. Losing diversity, especially species that occupy key trophic positions such as salamanders, compromises the population health of all species within the community.\nHow often are new species found?\nGB: With modern molecular phylogenetic tools, new species are described frequently. However, the rate of species loss is more troubling. We are losing them faster than we can describe them!\nHow does your research involve salamanders?\nGB: My collaborative research uses salamanders as model predators and wood frog tadpoles as prey species. We are examining the role ecological uncertainty plays in shaping the cognitive ecology of prey and predators. This is a key “missing piece” in our understanding of ecosystem sustainability, made even more important as climate change, invasive species and habitat degradation are all thought to increase the uncertainty.\nLearn more about research in Concordia’s Department of Biology . \n \n"}

The catch? There are worms involved. \nThe study’s lead author, Louise Hénault-Ethier, carried out her research while pursuing a master’s from what is now Concordia’s  Individualized program . She experimented with different methods of vermicomposting to see whether they could sufficiently inactivate certain bacteria for safe public use of the compost. \n“Centralized composting, which is one of the fastest growing industrial composting methods, has strict governmental guidelines, requiring thermal sanitation to prevent the survival of harmful bacteria,” she says.\nThe guidelines require that the compost reaches and maintains a heat of 55 degrees Celsius over a period of three days in a self-heating process driven by decomposer microorganisms found in the compost. \n“But in our case, worms graze on the decomposer community, preventing the onset of high temperatures. We wanted to see if vermicomposting, which proceeds at room temperature could still get rid of harmful bacteria.”\nHénault-Ethier worked with Concordia chemistry professor Yves Gélinas and biology professor  Vincent Martin to examine the impact of vermicomposting on E. coli, a bacteria often found in fecal matter that can easily make its way into organic waste set to be composted. \nThey devised three experiments to monitor the presence of E. coli, testing whether the size of the batch of compost, the amount of naturally occurring compost microbes and the rate at which the compost was fed would affect the survival of the pathogen. \nTime and again, the worms worked their magic and eventually produced compost that respected the regulatory bacterial count limits. When the normal compost microbes or worms were present, E. coli declined more rapidly. Without worms or with sterile compost, it took a little more time to get there.  \n\"We found that the compost batches take on average 18 to 21 days to decrease the E. coli to levels well below the legal limit,” explains Gélinas, who worked closely with Hénault-Ethier to examine how the chemicals, such as Carbon, Nitrogen or sugars, present in the compost materials would affect the bacteria’s survival.\n“While that's slower than traditional composting methods, it’s not a prohibitive amount of time.\"\n‘Upcycling waste’\nFor Hénault-Ethier, who was recently named head of scientific projects for the David Suzuki Foundation , it’s the added benefits of vermicomposting that are most important, beyond the results of the E. coli survival experiments.\n\"The compost it produces may lead to higher plant yields when used as a fertilizer, and — even more surprising — the red wigglers themselves could then be reused as feed for other animals on the food chain,” she says.\nThis is what's called “upcycling” — generating something more valuable than the initial waste product.\nAlthough the idea of using invertebrates as animal feed may seem a little strange, it’s actually a proven method for potentially replacing the resource-intensive soybeans or fish meal traditionally used. \n\"This study suggests that upcycling technologies like vermicomposting can be more widely developed for commercial use,” says Hénault-Ethier. As a past environmental coordinator for Concordia, she spearheaded a large-scale worm-farming project in which 15 tons of the university’s waste were composted per year.\n“Though traditional compost can rapidly kill potential pathogens through heat, industrial composting may actually take longer to reach maturity than vermicomposting. Why not wait a little longer to see pathogen declines in vermicomposting and then create a product that provides nutrient-rich feed to both plants and animals? It's a win-win situation.\"\nThe results show that vermicomposting is a promising method in the sanitation of organic waste, which would allow for producing proteins for animal feed.\nThat said, while the E. coli inactivation observed in the current study is promising, Hénault-Ethier cautions that further research on a more diverse array of pathogens is still required.\n"}

Great if you want to make bread or wine. Not so hot if it turns up as Candida albicans in large quantities in your body and makes you sick.\nA study recently published by a team of researchers led by Concordia professor Malcolm Whiteway in Current Biology shows that the type of yeast in bread is less similar to the type that causes fungal infections than previously thought.\nThe researchers hope that by shining new light on what makes the pathogen tick, his research may eventually help create targeted drugs .\nWhen yeast goes bad\nCandida albicans is the strain of yeast that causes relatively benign infections in people with strong immune systems. But it can be a serious threat to people with compromised immune systems, such as patients with AIDS or those undergoing chemotherapy or transplants of organs or bone marrow.\n“Blood-stream infections related to Candida are frequently fatal,” says Whiteway, who conducted the study with key collaborators Walters Tebung, a PhD candidate at Concordia, and Joachim Morschhauser with Germany’s Institut für Molekulare Infektionsbiologie.\n“Because the cells of this fungus function very similarly to human cells, the antibiotics that have been so successful in treating bacterial infections are not active against them,” Whiteway adds. “And the current anti-fungal drugs can have serious side effects. My research is aimed at helping to develop a new generation of anti-fungal drugs that have limited side effects.”\nYin yang yeast\nWhiteway and his colleagues examined how a cellular process in Candida albicans differs from the one in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast used in making bread and wine. Through “genetic rewiring,” the protein controlling a particular process in one yeast species controls a different process in the other.\nThe rewiring occurs in a protein named Ppr1. In Candida albicans, this protein controls the degrading of purines — molecules that make up DNA. But the Ppr1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae controls the building of pyrimidines — molecules that make up the elements of DNA complementary to purines.\n“Imagine two similar looking houses in Montreal and Toronto. In Montreal, when you flick a switch in the living room the lights come on. But when you flick the equivalent switch in the house in Toronto the stereo goes off. The same switch is doing different jobs,” says Whiteway, who also holds a Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics in the Faculty of Arts and Science.\n“We think the reason for this is because the yeast that makes bread and wine changed its metabolism to allow it to grow without much oxygen. This led to the pressure that generated the rewiring,” he says.\nNew treatment options\nPinpointing differences between bread-making and disease-causing yeasts gives us a picture of how cells can be remarkably different even when they look similar. That’s important from a drug production standpoint. Right now, it's common practice to use Saccharomyces to develop drugs to fight Candida.\n“This study proves that we have to study the pathogen itself. We can’t just study proxies and think drugs that will treat one will work in the other,” says Whiteway.\n“If you want drugs to fight Candida you’re better off working with Candida, even though Saccharomyces is easier to come by. The more we understand about how a fungal cell works, the better we can identify weak points in its armour.”\n“We hope it will one day lead to new treatment options for patients suffering from yeast infections, with the goal of faster healing and reduced suffering.”\n"}

Is this behaviour selfless or self-serving?\nSacha Engelhardt has spent years studying milk sharing, known as allonursing, while completing his PhD thesis in Robert Weladji's  lab at Concordia University.\nWeladji, an associate professor of biology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences , published his first scientific paper on reindeer in 2002. The northern ungulates have been central to his research ever since. His lab studies population ecology, behavioural ecology, biodiversity conservation and welfare of captive wildlife.\nEngelhardt’s work focuses on the advantages that reindeer calves have in a group. Many animal groups share the burden of childcare — the benefits of babysitting are obvious. But the risks of milk sharing can be greater than the rewards.\n“It’s a highly costly behaviour,” says Engelhardt. “It can reduce the amount of nutrients that a mother can provide to her offspring. Lactation is the most physiologically demanding part of mammalian reproduction.”\nNot only that, but he says that this kind of teat-sharing teamwork could lead to the spread of disease.\n \nSacha Engelhardt describes some of the challenges of his fieldwork. | Photo by Megan Perra\nTargeted cooperation?\nSo, why would a mother assume the risks just to help someone else’s calf? Engelhardt has exhausted several hypotheses in search of an answer, and he’s still coming up with more to explore.\n“We have evidence for kin selection, we have some evidence for improved nutrition, we have some evidence for reciprocation,” says Engelhardt. His paper , published earlier this year in the Journal of Mammalogy, suggests that reindeer mothers nurse the calves of their relatives more than others, but these results can vary depending on a study’s design.\nMothers and daughters that normally stick together for other seasons stay far apart during calving, weakening the idea that this is an activity reserved only for the extended family.\nEngelhardt recently published another paper in the Journal of Mammalian Biology on how allonursing calves receive better nutrition and gain weight more quickly.\nAs his previous research suggests, it may be that the reindeer mothers are not so much sharing their milk as they are trading it. So, a mother would nurse another calf because her own calf has nursed from someone else.\n“We’re not sure whether or not it is targeted cooperation,” says Engelhardt. “I can’t talk about their cognitive abilities so far.”\nWhat his most recent research does find, however, is that the reindeer don’t look to return the favour immediately after their calf has suckled from someone else. The chances of reciprocity actually increase over time, and many of these reciprocations happen between pairs of reindeer mothers.\nIt’s still unclear if this trading of milk between offspring is a conscious reciprocation of milk, but Engelhardt says he’s interested in further exploring this cooperative behaviour to perhaps determine whether or not it’s intentional.\nFind out more about Concordia's Department of Biology.\n \n"}

He will offer his perspective on the process consulting stance and on the dilemmas that often arise when a consultant intervenes in complex social systems. Conklin will suggest that the skilled intervener engages in four critical balancing acts:\nBalancing the need to challenge and at times push the client toward success with the need to create safety and to show compassion for the client. The intervener is confrontational and compassionate.\nBalancing the need to engage in planned and intentional activity with the need to be open to the emergent and unexpected. The intervener stays the course and changes course.\nBalancing the need to become part of the client system with the need to remain distinct and apart. The intervener participates and observes.\nBalancing the inclination to tell the client the solution to client problems with the need to create the conditions in which members of the client system can discover the answers for themselves. The intervener asserts and inquires.\nThe evening will allow participants to consider the strengths and opportunities that await those who wish to become more conscious and effective facilitators of social change.\nWhere\nRoom RF-100, Loyola Jesuit Hall and Conference Centre (7141 Sherbrooke W.),\nSpeakers\n"}

Why do young people vote infrequently and what can we do about it? Is the system of voting in Canada broken, and if so, how can it be fixed? Is internet voting likely in the future? These are very real concerns and this two-day workshop gives you an opportunity to discuss them with British Columbia’s current Chief Electoral Officer, Keith Archer.\nThis workshop will cover topics such as how elections are run in Canada (and how they can be improved); youth electoral disengagement (and what can be done about it); drawing electoral boundaries (and the meaning of effective representation); transparency in electoral financing (and why this is so important in democracies). We’ll also discuss whether our current method of running elections, and of voting, are outdated, and whether major changes are (or should be) forthcoming.\nGo beyond the basics and dig deeper into economic, political, and procedural underpinnings of elections. Also, what kind of electoral reform is under consideration at the federal and provincial levels in Canada, and what are the prospects for reform?\n"}

Several of the 94 Calls to Action outlined in the report link to the mandate of post-secondary institutions, particularly those surrounding education for reconciliation. Recognizing the importance and magnitude of this work, this community of practice gathering will focus on the ways in which we can integrate indigenous voices, knowledge and leaders into our teaching. What impact can this have and how can it be achieved? What fears and hesitations hold each of us back?  Most importantly, when we partner with community members on our efforts to respond to the TRC, how can we ensure that we do so in a way that is both meaningful and mutually beneficial? \nGuests:\n"}

From astronomy to culinary chemistry, these educational offerings will whet your appetite\nPosted on September 20, 2016\n|\nBy: Meagan Boisse\n“Did you enjoy The Martian? If so, we may have a course for you.” | Image: Twentieth Century Fox\nIn celebration of Science Literacy Week (Sept. 19-25), the Concordia news desk is highlighting a related activity every day. See Monday's Wiki for women in STEM!  and Wednesday's  Rocketry and robotics at Space Concordia .\nSo you’re not a scientist. But like anyone with an inquisitive mind, you still grapple with life’s existential questions: Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? How close to reality is Jurassic Park?\nGood news! You don’t need be an expert to explore the realms of science and space. Concordia offers a myriad of courses that address some of these fundamental queries while exploring a range of subjects, from the vast expanses of the universe to the tiniest life-giving particles.\n \nGeneral Biology\n“Do you want to know why you need to eat food and breathe oxygen? The difference between science and pseudoscience? Or what your ancient ancestors looked like? Then General Biology is for you,” says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , who teaches BIOL 202: General Biology.\nThe course covers the fundamentals of biology and the chemistry of life. Learn about the structure and functions of cells and tissues, as well as aspects of anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, heredity and evolution.\n“It’s designed for non-scientists who are still curious about life. Through it you will learn the makings of life using everyday examples,” says Gray-Mitsumune.\n \nFundamental Nutrition\nWhere does cooking and science collide? In BIOL 203: Fundamental Nutrition, of course, where you’ll take a hands-on approach to food composition.\n“Cooking teaches us food chemistry. Thankfully, every home still comes equipped with a kitchen,” says instructor Catherine Calogeropoulos , who teaches her students the science of nutrition through an array of culinary experiments.\nCan you use milk in a sauce recipe that calls for cream? Probably not, says Calogeropoulos. Relative to milk, cream contains a lot less protein. Under high heat, milk can cause the sauce to curdle — and make you look like a foolish foodie.\n“Science reveals itself magically before our eyes in the kitchen. By perusing the molecular gastronomy literature I’ve found perfect cooking examples to anchor nearly all the scientific concepts that might elude my students and senior auditors,” she says.\n \nFundamentals of Health and Physical Activity\nThis course touches upon a range of topics: cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, weight management, nutrition, disease prevention and even stress management.\n“Students will gain both knowledge and tools to maximize their health and energy, immediately and in the long term,” says instructor Leslie Barker, who teaches EXCI 251: Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity.\n“Many students comment that EXCI 251 helped them improve their own negative eating, smoking, stress and inactivity habits, while they also learned to differentiate between scientific facts and marketing hype,” adds Barker.\n \nForensic Analysis\nEveryone knows that DNA analysis revolutionized forensics, but how? If you want to find out,  Cameron Skinner , associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, suggests you take CHEM 298 AA.\n“Our approach is to first learn the underlying principles by starting with the basics such as molecules, chemical reactions and so on, before working our way towards the sophisticated tools used in a modern forensics lab,” says Skinner.\n“You will finish the course with a more realistic understanding of the field of forensics. You'll also understand the capacities and limitations of modern analysis. Some of the lessons will be case studies, some will be drawn from the textbook ... and there will be an occasional poisoning and/or murder.”\nPlease note: Skinner says he will not take responsibility for any damages or strife caused when you begin yelling at your TV during crime shows such as CSI.\n \nDiscovering Biotechnology\n“Did you enjoy The Martian?  Were you thrilled by Jurassic Park?  Did Gattaca give you pause for thought? If so, we may have a course for you,” says Paul Joyce , a professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Concordia.\nCHEM 209: Discovering Biotechnology begins with an exploration of the roles that genes and proteins play in life processes.\nIt then examines the basic principles behind the manipulation of biological molecules to produce desired changes. The course also explores the ethical ramifications of such actions.\n“Would you like to know how close we are to establishing a base on Mars? Or if we can really clone dinosaurs (or people, for that matter)? Or how close we are to the spectre of genetic discrimination?” asks Joyce. “Then register for this course.”\n \nIntroduction to Astronomy\nBlack holes, constellations, the Milky Way galaxy and beyond — PHYS 284: Introduction to Astronomy is the course for anyone interested in space.\n“Students will be introduced to advanced topics from cosmology, including the Big Bang theory, as well as the study of extra-solar planets and the search for extraterrestrial life,” says Mario D’Amico from Concordia’s Department of Physics.\nPHYS 284 will be offered as an online course this winter session. Browse through multimedia components and narrated lectures on major topics in astronomy, from the comfort of your own couch.\n“Students will have the flexibility of taking the course using their computers. They will therefore not be required to travel, or even be located in Montreal,” adds D'Amico.\n \nRegister online through the MyConcordia portal for these classes. Space is limited.\n \n"}

Now a team of Concordia biologists is putting this ancient organism under the microscope to understand how to slow human aging and delay the onset of diseases of aging, including cancer.\nLed by Vladimir Titorenko, professor in the Department of Biology and Concordia University Research Chair in Genomics, Cell Biology and Aging, the team studies the aging of yeast cells in a state-of-the-art laboratory in Concordia’s Richard J. Renaud Science Pavilion on the Loyola Campus. The work is part of an ongoing project in tandem with research partners in Montreal and Saskatoon.\nAnd their effort has led to some promising discoveries.\n“Quite simply, we study aging of baker’s yeast to understand how to slow aging and extend the healthy lifespan of humans,” says Vladimir Titorenko (centre), professor in the department of biology, of the experiments being carried out in his lab in Concordia’s Richard J. Renaud Science Pavilion.  He is pictured with researchers Pamela Dakik and Younes Medkour.\nYeast, Titorenko explains, is an ideal material on which to conduct experiments in aging for several reasons. “It’s been known for a very long time that many features of yeast cells have biological processes that are very close to the same kinds of processes that occur in human cells, and that includes aging and diseases of old age,” he says.\nThe yeast most commonly used in these experiments is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the kind used in making bread, beer and wine. “Most of the genes which are now known to regulate aging in animals and other organisms have been discovered in yeast first,” Titorenko says, adding that the same sets of genes responsible for aging in yeast are also responsible for aging in mice. Also, studies of aging in yeast have led to the discovery of most of the chemical molecules that can delay aging in animals.\nAnother advantage to working with yeast cells is that they age much more rapidly than the cells of many other organisms, which is a great time saver for the researchers. Titorenko points out that the aging process for mice can take up to three years, which makes for a long experiment period, while a comparable study using yeast cells can be carried out in as little as two weeks.\nTitorenko and other scientists believe that questions about how our bodies age are crucial to cancer research because the two are so closely associated. “Cancer is considered to be an age-related disorder, along with neurodegenerative ones such as Parkinson’s disease,” he explains. “That’s why we are interested in how some chemical molecules of natural origin can delay aging.”\nBile acid kills cancer cells\nThe research process may be slow, but the passion and relentless curiosity shared by Titorenko’s graduate student researchers and their supervisor drives them — and all it takes is one “eureka!” moment to push the whole process forward and charge the young scientists with renewed enthusiasm. One of those moments occurred during a robotic screening process of thousands of natural chemical molecules to find several groups of molecules that delay yeast aging. Among them was a group of relatively common bile acid molecules found in the human body.\nTitorenko and his colleagues published a paper outlining their discovery that bile acids produced by the liver are especially effective in delaying the aging process in yeast and therefore show promise as a possible weapon against cancer cells — a theory that has been further developed by his research partners.\n“We were trying to identify molecules that can delay aging in yeast, so we conducted a screening,” Titorenko says of how it all came about. “We tested with the help of a robot many thousands of different chemical compounds from commercially available collections to see which of them would delay aging in yeast, and we found more than 20 of them.”\nTitorenko points out that a bile acid called lithocholic acid was one chemical group found to be most effective in delaying aging. Lithocholic acid is considered to be a secondary bile acid, he explains, because it is produced by bacteria in the colon rather than the liver.\nA long road to Concordia\nTitorenko’s lifelong interest in biological and chemical sciences led him on a career path that brought him to Concordia in 2002. Originally from the former Soviet Union, his academic credentials began accumulating with bachelor and graduate degrees in biochemistry from Lvov (now Lviv) University in Ukraine. From there he earned a PhD in genetics from the Institute of Genetics and Selection of Industrial Microorganisms in Moscow, which was followed by a three-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.\nHe later came to Canada to undertake a second postdoc fellowship, this one at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, which preceded his move to Montreal and his current position at Concordia.\n“My primary interest for a very long time was completely far away from aging or cancer,” Titorenko says. “It was how a certain type of organelle known as peroxisome is formed, specifically in yeast cells. But at a certain point I switched my interest to aging, specifically the molecular mechanism of cell aging in yeast, and I’ve been doing that for about the past eight years.”\nAlong the way, Titorenko has maintained a high profile in the academic community as a lecturer and a prolific author and editor, having written or contributed to more than 100 scientific papers and five books. His work has brought him into contact with some of the scientists and academics with whom he still collaborates today. As a result, his team of researchers at Concordia are not working alone — their lab is part of a network of related aging and cancer research projects underway across Canada.\nA dedicated team\nTitorenko’s research on yeast cells is being carried out with the help of a team of graduate students he has recruited to see to the day-to-day operation of the lab. Each is assigned a specific function to perform in the process.\nPamela Dakik, BSc (biol.) 15, is exactly where she wants to be right now. Dakik has always had a passion for science, especially biology, and has followed that academic path since high school. Dakik now finds herself not only working on a major research project just a year after completing her undergraduate degree, but also fast-tracked to begin her PhD in September.\n“I took a class with Titorenko and then started volunteering in his lab,” Dakik says of how she first became involved in the project. “I saw the work being done, and after two semesters I took a course where I had a chance to conduct hypothesis-driven experiments, working with the yeast cells and aging. I liked it so much that right after I graduated I applied for a graduate degree in Titorenko’s lab.”\nPart of Dakik’s task is to screen a library of numerous plant extracts in a robust experimental procedure, which allows researchers to identify extracts capable of increasing yeast longevity by delaying aging of yeast cells. The plant extracts Dakik uses are supplied by Idunn Technologies, a scientific research and development company in Rosemère, Que., that specializes in natural health products, especially those associated with aging.\nWith the natural extracts, Dakik begins what is called the screening process aimed at identifying the most efficient aging-delaying natural products. “I start off by testing those numerous plant extracts with the yeast cells and try to see which of them can greatly extend yeast longevity and, thus, delay the aging process,” she explains. “After that, I try to determine the ideal concentration — as with any drug you take there are different concentrations: too high may be toxic, too low might not work.”\nShe then use genetic approaches to assess which pathways are targeted by each of the aging-delaying plant extracts. “I also look into the abilities of certain combinations of these plant extracts to delay aging more efficiently than each of them does individually,” Dakik says. “Once I answer those questions, the other grad students take a more in-depth look at how each of these plant extracts delay aging by impacting various processes in the yeast cell.”\nFor his part, Younes Medkour, BSc (biol.) 15, indulges his love of microscopy and systems biology to determine how and to what extent the yeast cells are affected by each of the aging-delaying plant extracts. “My role is to find what specific processes in various cellular organelles are altered by each of these extracts, and to understand why and how these alterations delay aging,” he says. “I use a combination of experimental approaches to answer these essential questions. These approaches include quantitative mass spectrometry of lipids and proteins, microscopy and bioinformatics.”\nMedkour, who also fast-tracked his studies to begin his PhD in September, had initially intended to study biology as a prelude to medical school yet found himself bitten by the research bug after applying his computer skills in bioinformatics through Selvadurai Dayanandan, a professor in the Department of Biology. Medkour came to Titorenko’s attention when he presented his honours project aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer. This, he says, made it a lot easier for him when he later applied for a graduate research position in Titorenko’s lab.\nOnce there, everything changed for him. “When I saw the research that was going on, I said to myself, ‘This is where I belong, not in med school!’”\nAmanda Piano, BSc (biol.) 14, MSc (biol.) 16, is currently pursuing a certificate in biotechnology at McGill University after completing both her undergrad and graduate degrees while working with yeast cells in Titorenko’s lab. “I was immediately drawn to the research being done in the Titorenko lab and initially joined as a volunteer to explore the prospect of a future in research,” says Piano, who found her passion for biology while a CEGEP student at Dawson College in Montreal.\n“At Dawson, the biology classes were broad and general, but while at Concordia I found myself gravitating towards more specialized work in cell biology,” she recalls. “The intricacy and complexity of the cell and its workings always fascinated me.” Piano claims that Titorenko’s friendliness and dedication to his students combine to play a big role in the research team’s success. “He is devoted and approachable, which makes a great supervisor,” she says.\nCross-country partners\nThe experiments being carried out at Titorenko’s lab are currently focused on yeast; the work on actual cancer cells is being done at research facilities of other institutions by Titorenko’s longstanding colleagues and collaborators — each of whom have been working with lithocholic bile acid and have discovered its effectiveness in not only delaying the aging process but also killing the cells of neuroblastoma, prostate and breast cancers.\nAmong Titorenko’s primary research partners is Andréa C. LeBlanc, a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at McGill, who is a leading researcher at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research at the Jewish General Hospital. LeBlanc’s research with lithocholic acid has led to the discovery that it selectively kills cultured human neuroblastoma cells — a cancer that commonly attacks the adrenal glands.\nAnother collaborator, Troy A.A. Harkness of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, has done extensive research on the treatment of tumours and has worked closely with the Canadian Cancer Society. His experiments with lithocholic acid found that it selectively kills cultured human breast cancer cells as well.\nLikewise, toxicologist Thomas Sanderson, associate professor at the INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier in Laval, Que., heads a research team whose work with lithocholic bile acid has determined that it selectively destroys cultured human prostate cancer cells.\nWhile these discoveries are promising, they are currently restricted to Petri dishes and microscope slides. Titorenko says it will be a while before any of their findings will be applied to human subjects, as a further series of experiments on mice or other animals must first be completed in order to safely determine how their cells react to the lithocholic bile acid.\nTitorenko admits that he and his fellow researchers are sometimes frustrated by the long research process — but at the same time he’s thankful to be working with yeast, as that has sped up the timeline by a considerable margin. “Of course we want to see the results very quickly,” Titorenko says with a smile. “But we must be patient.” \nRelated links\n"}

For millennia, humans have fought the process of aging using everything from fountains of youth to pricey face creams, all to no avail. But a group of Montreal-based researchers is coming ever closer to achieving healthy longevity — armed with the power of science. \nIn a study recently published in Oncotarget , researchers from Concordia University and Idunn Technologies assess how six previously identified plant extracts can delay aging by affecting different signaling pathways that set the pace of growing old.\nVladimir Titorenko\nVladimir Titorenko  is a biology professor and the study’s senior author. He says that the potential of using these plant extracts for delaying the onset of age-related diseases is underscored by the fact that Health Canada classifies them as safe for human consumption. Five of them are recommended by the federal department as health-improving supplements with clinically proven benefits.\nIn the study, Titorenko and his co-authors confirmed that one extract is particularly effective: Salix alba, more commonly known as white willow bark, is the most potent aging-delaying pharmacological intervention yet described.\nTo make this identification, the researchers used yeast to test the effectiveness of the plant extracts. But why yeast? That’s because, at a cellular level, aging progresses similarly in yeast and humans. In both, the pace of aging is defined by a distinct set of chemical reactions arranged into several cascades. These cascades, which scientists call “signalling pathways,” regulate the rate of aging in a wide range of organisms.\nUsing yeast — the best cellular aging model — Titorenko and his colleagues monitored how the information flowing through each of these signalling pathways was affected by  each of the six aging-delaying plant extracts.\n“It’s known that some of these signalling pathways delay aging if activated in response to certain nutrients or hormones,” he says. “These pathways are called ‘anti-aging’ or ‘pro-longevity’ pathways. Other signalling pathways speed up aging if activated in response to certain other nutrients or hormones. These pathways are called ’pro-aging’ or ‘pro-death’ pathways.”\nCo-author Éric Simard, CEO of Idunn Technologies, explains that each of the six aging-delaying plant extracts targets a different anti-aging or pro-aging signalling pathway.\nIt is especially noteworthy that this study revealed the following features of the six plant extracts as potential tools in decelerating chronic symptoms and diseases of old age:\nThey imitate the aging-delaying effects of the caloric restriction diet in yeast\nThey slow yeast aging by eliciting a mild stress response\nThey extend yeast longevity more efficiently than any lifespan-prolonging chemical compound yet described\nThey delay aging through signalling pathways implicated in age-related diseases\nOne of them delays aging via a previously unknown pathway\nThey extend longevity and delay the onset of age-related diseases in organisms other than yeast\n“This study is an important step forward for science because these signaling pathways could eventually  delay the onset and progression of chronic diseases associated with human aging,” says Simard, who has recently published a  new book  on the topic.\n“These diseases include arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, liver dysfunction, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, and many forms of cancer.”\n"}

One way is to change the way we teach.\nThis is exactly what Catherine Calogeropoulos , a part-time instructor in Concordia's Department of Biology , is doing with her “BIOL 203 - Fundamental Nutrition” course. Her challenge? Figuring out a way to make complicated scientific concepts understandable to non-science students. Enter the professional chef.\nTo accompany each lesson, Calogeropoulos shows a video segment of a seasoned cook preparing a meal that supports the concept of the day. “The cooking reinforces the chemistry,” she explains. “It’s easier to understand how lipids work by seeing how mayonnaise is made.”\nBut the course isn’t just about understanding science fundamentals. “It's also about learning vital life skills. I want my students to come away from my course enjoying cooking and knowing how to make healthy, sustainable, inexpensive meals.”\n‘My hope is to stir interest in science’\nChanging the way we teach isn’t just about providing students with alternative ways to digest tough material; it’s also about adapting the way we approach the classroom experience.\nMario D’Amico , a part-time professor in the Department of Physics , teaches “PHYS 298 - Introduction to Astronomy,” a blended course on the foundations of the discipline.\nFor his elective, which attracts students ranging in age from 18 to 80, D’Amico finds the flexibility of the blended approach an advantage. “Attendance to the lecture portion is optional,” he explains. “So those with time or travel constraints can learn most of the course on their computers.”\nThe environment also offers flexibility in the way students can complete their work. “Using online assignments with computer-generated marks and feedback allows them the opportunity to retry questions they get wrong.” This helps those without a science background learn difficult concepts while still keeping their grades up.\nTaking D’Amico’s course is about more than just getting a passing grade to fulfill an elective. “We are at the dawn of space exploration and at the frontiers of scientific innovation,” he says. “My hope is to stir interest in science, physics and astronomy while ensuring that students enjoy a very relaxed experience.”\n \nFor more blended learning opportunities at Concordia, check out Concordia's first ever Massive Open Online Course .\n \n"}

From the white rhino to the blue whale, numbers are dwindling in the face of poaching, habitat destruction and climate change. Although the situation may seem dire, new research gives us reason to hope.\nA study recently published in Evolutionary Applications by a group of Concordia biologists shows that small populations of species can still adapt and respond to natural selection.\n“Our research shows that, just because an animal or plant is few in numbers, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they can’t be brought back from the brink of extinction — they might still possess enough genetic diversity to respond to changing conditions through natural selection,” says biology professor Dylan Fraser , one of the study’s authors.\nBut, he warns, “I wouldn’t advocate that we can hammer down every species. There are a number of concerns always, but from a genetic standpoint, small population size may not be as bad as we initially thought.”\nFor the study, Fraser and his co-authors — Jacquelyn Wood, the senior author who recently graduated from Concordia with her PhD and now works for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry , and current PhD candidate Matthew Yates — combed through empirical studies produced between 1980 and 2014.\nThey produced an extremely thorough database that maps the extent of natural selection and amount of genetic diversity underlying traits needed to adapt to environmental change of 146 separate population groups across 83 different species, ranging from simple plants to large mammals.\n“We found little evidence for consistent differences in genetic variance, or the extent of natural selection across a wide gradient of population size in nature. These are notable results given the large size of the data set and the general lack of research investigating patterns of selection in relation to population size in wild species,” says Fraser.\n“Our results don’t jibe with the widespread view that small populations should have lower amounts of genetic variation. We observed no significant effects of population size on genetic variance in our analysis.” \nThis finding has important implications for conservation efforts, which should consider that the evolutionary trajectories of some small populations appear to be very much affected by natural selection, and different small and large populations of the same species may contain variation that is adaptive in a wide range of circumstances. What’s more, minimum viable population sizes for some species may not need to be as high as previously thought.\nWhile this is cause for hope, Fraser recommends we proceed with cautious optimism.\n“Our findings don’t mean that all species are robust and can handle depletion, but it generally hints that there must be situations in nature that allow small populations to adapt to environmental change. If we can pinpoint which species can handle small population size, and even specific populations within species, it will influence conservation efforts.”\nPartners in research: This study was funded in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council .\n \nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Biology .\n \n"}

It’s great to see Concordia taking steps toward interdisciplinary thinking.”\nLafontaine, who is associate director of ACT, agrees universities could be doing more to promote interdisciplinary dialogue. “We say we work in an interdisciplinary way, but we don’t actually always do the legwork that’s necessary for that to happen.”\nThe first podcast episode, like the first Beyond Disciplines event, looks at the emergence of CRISPR technology , a gene-editing tool that’s been making headlines . Experts who took part came from the Faculty’s Biology , Political Science , Journalism , and Philosophy departments.\n“It was really interesting to see how some of this issue resonated beyond disciples,” says Lafontaine. “For instance, people in Biology were very concerned about the politics of CRISPR, so seeing these common concerns was very enlightening.”\n“I am very proud of our \"Pod Squad\",” says Sawchuk. “Their work is a testament to the amazing talent we have within our Faculty. I hope this podcast will be a way for even more people to hear about the exciting work we have going on across so many disciplines.”\nNow that the first episode has premiered, the Squad is looking forward to audiences hearing the next two episodes.\n“Complex ideas cannot be reduced down to one person’s opinion, or a couple of social media posts,” says Besanger. “We need to be willing to listen to multiple perspectives, draw connections, and think through the messiness. Ultimately, I hope this podcast prompts listeners to consider the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving.”\nLafontaine hopes the audience will embrace the curiosity at heart of the Beyond Disciplines series. “I don’t necessarily hope they come away with answers, but definitely hope they come away with more questions!”\nTo listen to the first episode and read the transcript of the Beyond Disciplines podcast, \"Editing our future with CRISPR\", click here .\nRelated topics\n"}

Après plusieurs années à suivre les traces des premiers explorateurs vikings qui ont foulé le sol du Nouveau Monde, l’artiste s’est rendue au Groenland pour rejoindre une équipe d’archéologues danois œuvrant à la restauration des ruines des colonies nordiques les mieux préservées du monde. Dans ce paysage à mi-chemin entre l’Ancien et le Nouveau Monde, l’histoire se révèle au fil des strates qu’elle parcourt.

Le jour suivant, des émeutes ont éclaté et un mouvement social est alors né : Montréal-Nord Républik. Le meurtre de Fredy Villanueva a non seulement attisé le sentiment d’exclusion sociale et le mécontentement qui sommeillaient depuis des années, mais aussi mis en lumière les tactiques de surveillance policière actuelles, l’asymétrie des pouvoirs institutionnels et le profilage racial.

Réorientés dans leur forme comme dans leur fonction, les objets s’inscrivent dans un vaste vocabulaire thématique. Le spectateur est alors invité à faire fi des conventions pour considérer non seulement l’artefact, mais également son rapport avec lui. Entre chaque œuvre, des espaces acoustiques collectifs lui permettent en outre de tendre l’oreille aux modulations de sa propre écoute.\nArtist / Artiste\nAdam Basanta\nEN\nAdam Basanta (b. 1985) is a Montreal-based sound artist, composer, and performer of experimental music.

Image courtesy of the artists.\nEN\nDonna Akrey and Yvette Poorter are a collaborative duo that have been making/continue to make work together when they can since the 1990s (or since they jumped off a cliff into Muskoka water at age 17). Their work is multi-media and often involves easily found and/or scavenged materials. They are interested in getting lost while realizing the rarity of such a thing. So they make work to get lost in. Poorter and Akrey have been collecting stories and images from people who have a dead dad. They use these snippets of other people’s memories, as fuel to create a morphing landscape installation. Yes, the exhibition is about dads—dead dads at that—but it is also a rumination on memory and the size and viscosity of memory. A vague longing.\nExposition\nDonna Akrey et Yvette Poorter\nDu 10 avril au 19 mai 2017\nFR\nDonna Akrey et Yvette Poorter collaborent, au gré de leur disponibilité, depuis les années 1990 (ou depuis qu’elles ont sauté d’une falaise dans les eaux de Muskoka à l’âge de 17 ans). Leur œuvre multimédia fait souvent appel à des matériaux facilement trouvés ou récupérés. Bien qu’elles souhaitent pouvoir se perdre, elles réalisent la rareté d’une telle possibilité et cherchent donc plutôt à se perdre dans leurs créations. Le duo recueille des récits et des images de personnes dont le père est mort. Elles se servent de ces fragments de souvenirs d’autrui pour concevoir une installation paysagère évolutive. L’exposition traite ainsi des pères – des pères disparus, qui plus est –, mais il s’agit également d’une rumination sur la mémoire, sur sa portée et sa viscosité.

Such literary sources are also essential to democratic discourse because they provide a way to engage in politics through critique and protest.\nTargeting experts from political science, English, comparative literature, classics, history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and the liberal arts, this workshop will identify crosscutting research areas which explore the important contribution of alternative epistemological approaches to understanding, promoting, and critiquing democratic practices. Within this theme, the one-day event will investigate the state of research on literary approaches to democratic political thought and identify key areas for future research.

When it comes to more technical or specialized knowledge, the degrees and prestige granted by one’s association with a university makes the expert/non-expert dynamic even more pronounced.  Recognizing that, in the interest of mutually beneficial partnerships where the learning flows in all directions, it is important to take steps to breakdown these hierarchies, this community of practice event invites participants to consider what it would take to meaningfully level the playing field.\nBy recognizing the presence and the impact of the academic gaze, what steps can we take to address it?  What participatory practices might enable us to value and integrate less formalized ways of knowing and non-academic expertise? What would change if we modeled these same practices in our classroom? How can we best support our students as they learn to work more collaboratively with their community partners and each other?\nTogether, we will explore what it means to take democracy seriously in space and time.

The Department’s programs inspire students with an appreciation of the rich diversity of the living world.\nStudents acquire a comprehensive grounding in modern biology through classroom study as well as extensive hands-on training in research methodology. A variety of specialized laboratories and equipment supports both research and teaching activities.\nPrograms\nThe Biology Department offers Honours and Specialization programs in Biology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and Ecology, as well as Major and Minor programs in Biology. Students planning a career or graduate studies in the biological sciences normally follow the appropriate honours or specialization program. The major program is designed for students who wish to study biology and either obtain a more general education or pursue an additional program in another discipline. The major program can be combined with a major in another department.\nStudents registered in the Honours, Specialization, or Major in Biology may select Biology electives in various subject areas in order to obtain a broad overview of the discipline. However, it is possible for students to pursue in-depth studies in specific areas such as animal biology, plant biology, or microbiology and biotechnology.\nThe minor program can only be taken by students registered in another degree program and provides an opportunity to gain a basic exposure to the main sub-disciplines of Biology or to pursue one such area in some depth.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to take advantage of academic counselling services available in the Biology Department in order to select the program and courses that best meet their needs. Students may transfer among programs after the first year of study since the core courses in all programs are quite similar.\nStudents are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements.\nThe superscript indicates credit value.\nStudents seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in the program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.\n72    BSc Honours in Biology\n27     BIOL 2253, 2263, 2613, 2663, 3673, 4906; CHEM 2213*, 2713\n  3     Chosen from BIOL 3223; CHEM 2123\n12     Chosen from BIOL 2273, 3303, 3373, 3403, 3643, 3663, 3713, 3823, 3853\n30     Chosen from Biology credits** at the 300 and/or 400 levels with at least nine\n         credits at the 400 level\nNOTE: Biology lab requirement: Students must take at least nine credits from Biology courses with lab components (BIOL 227, 330, 337, 340, 368, 382, 450, 466).\nNOTE: Students seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in another program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.

Emphatically so — if you’re biology researcher Grant Brown , that is. On the heels of last week’s discovery of three new species of nearly extinct salamander, the Faculty of Arts and Science professor tells us more about these environmental wizards of the amphibian world.\nWhat makes salamanders so special?\nGrant Brown: Salamanders are particularly interesting because of their trophic position within food webs.  They are prey to a variety of species — birds, mammals and snakes, for example — and are predators on many others, like tadpoles, aquatic invertebrates, some fish and terrestrial invertebrates.\nGiven their role as both predator and prey, they are often used as an indicator of ecosystem health. Anything that disturbs their prey or their predators will be reflected by the salamander population. \nWhy are salamanders particularly good indicators of environmental shifts?\nGB: Salamanders are often considered the “canary in the coal mine” because they are susceptible to small changes in habitat quality. A slight drop in ambient water: they die. A slight increase in acidity in breeding ponds: they die.\nAny animal that has a relatively short life span can be considered an indicator as subtle changes in the environmental quality will be more easily spotted. You can’t wait around to see how small changes affect long-living species.\nWhat's the significance of the discovery of three new species of salamander?\nGB: Describing three new species highlights the importance of preserving natural habitats. Natural and diverse habitat types maintain healthy biodiversity. Losing diversity, especially species that occupy key trophic positions such as salamanders, compromises the population health of all species within the community.\nHow often are new species found?\nGB: With modern molecular phylogenetic tools, new species are described frequently. However, the rate of species loss is more troubling. We are losing them faster than we can describe them!\nHow does your research involve salamanders?\nGB: My collaborative research uses salamanders as model predators and wood frog tadpoles as prey species. We are examining the role ecological uncertainty plays in shaping the cognitive ecology of prey and predators. This is a key “missing piece” in our understanding of ecosystem sustainability, made even more important as climate change, invasive species and habitat degradation are all thought to increase the uncertainty.\nLearn more about research in Concordia’s Department of Biology . \n \n"}

I began a Master’s Degree in 2014 with Dr. Grant E. Brown, where my research focused on studying Neophobia in Trinidadian Guppies.\nI was recently fast-tracked into the PhD program, where I will continue and expand upon my research. The amazing community of students, faculty, and staff at Concordia played a large role in my decision to stay for my PhD.\n In addition to pursuing graduate studies at Concordia, I am also the Science Liaison Officer for the Student Success Center, where I work with Student Learning Services to create and design improved study and tutoring programs for science students.\nThe resources available at Concordia and the wonderful support from both students and faculty have played a huge role in my academic success. I have built friendships and connections that will last a life time.\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo (Department of History):\nI am second-year MA History student. In my thesis, I explore the life and work of fin-de-siècle French literary critic, novelist, and traveller Thérèse (Th.) Bentzon, writing a history of her intellectual life across borders. Using Bentzon’s travelogues about the ‘condition of women’ in the United States and Canada as a starting point, I investigate the link between mobility, the development of feminism, and the making of a modern self in the nineteenth century. \nI came to history by way of journalism, having completed a BA in Journalism and German at Concordia. I was originally drawn to the Master’s program in History because of the groundbreaking work being done at the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.\nThat said, the History Department has given me the invaluable opportunity to explore my research interests in gender and women’s history, histories of empire, travel, global feminism, and autobiography and life writings. My supervisor, Dr. Barbara Lorenzkowski, grounds me in the historical craft while also encouraging me to forge links across disciplinary boundaries.\nPrior to starting graduate studies, my time as a student journalist took me to Istanbul, where I reported on the Gezi Park protests in 2013, and to Munich, where I worked in communications and penned a travel blog in the summer of 2014. As an early-career scholar, I aim to combine the storytelling elements of journalism with the academic rigueur of a historian through her work.\nI hope to pursue my PhD in History, looking at the comparative emergence of feminist ideologies in France and Britain in the nineteenth century, as of Fall 2017.\nRelated topics\n"}

He’s travelled to South Africa, the Galapagos Islands and Clipperton, a remote island in the Pacific Ocean — all in the name of shark research.\nThomas Leszkiewicz’s photo of a great white shark off of the coast of South Africa.\nFrom an early age, Leszkiewicz had a keen interest in nature and wildlife. While he was born in Montreal, his Polish heritage meant that much of his childhood was spent outdoors.\n“Polish people have an affinity to nature, so my parents really instigated this passion I have,” he says. “From picking mushrooms in the forest with my mom, fishing with my dad and travelling to the ocean as a family with my sister, all of it had a profound impact on me.”\nLeszkiewicz — who learned English by watching children’s TV shows Barney and Mister Rogers — credits Time magazine for spurring his interest in sharks. The publication declared 2011 the “Summer of the Shark” after a high number of attacks and sightings.\n“I vividly remember standing on a pier fishing when a big bull shark appeared. It could have been 20 metres away from swimmers but it was just cruising around not interested in the bathers whatsoever,” he says.\n“That incident made me realize as a young kid that they are not mindless killers, and my interest in them skyrocketed!” “Shortly afterwards someone on the beach yelled, ‘Shark!’ and chaos ensued.”\nDespite those seaside memories with family, choosing to study biology at Concordia was far from an easy decision for Leszkiewicz.\n“I was debating to go into engineering. However, after watching the documentary Sharkwater, I decided to go with my heart and study biology,” he says. “The university helped me a lot. I had amazing and passionate teachers.”\nLeszkiewicz credits two professors in Concordia’s Department of Biology in particular for their support.\n“Bhupinder Mangat had a profound effect on me in my earlier years,” Leszkiewicz says. “We took the same train, so I got to chat a lot with him one on one! It was sad hearing of his passing.” Mangat died in 2012.\n“The other is Dylan Fraser. His classes were always intriguing and made my last year the best. He ended up writing a letter of recommendation for my internship in South Africa,” Leszkiewicz says.\nLeszkiewicz with a Giant Manta Ray off Clipperton Island, near Mexico. | Photo: Jenni Whiteley Photography\nLeszkiewicz’s 2012 Galapagos Islands trip was organized through the Concordia Biology Students Association. While on the island, he cut down invasive plant species and planted coffee beans — low profile work, he says, that fuelled his love for the Great Whites.\n“Visiting those islands is a must for any biology enthusiast,” Leszkiewicz says.\nHe also saw Lonesome George, the last known giant tortoise from Pinta Island. At the time, George was considered the world’s rarest animal because of his age — 102 years — and the fact that he was too shy to reproduce.\n“Poor guy died a couple weeks later in his sleep, so we were really lucky,” he says. “There is much to say about the Galapagos Islands, a true paradise unlike any other.”\nIn 2014, he spent two months as an intern for the South Africa-based Oceans Campus, helping a group of doctoral students in their research efforts. During the expedition, Leszkiewicz was a diver-of-all-trades, doing everything from filling water with bait to luring sharks with tuna heads to spotting sharks from the top of the boat.\n“Working out in the ocean each day on a boat surrounded by white sharks is definitely an unforgettable experience,” Leszkiewicz says. “We had one scary moment where a female white shark torpedoed towards a tuna head we were using as bait and slammed into our boat.”\nMore recently in Clipperton, Leszkiewicz had a hands-on role — literally. As part of a team of scientists, and researchers, he was given the task of attaching sensory tags to the sharks for researchers to track their movements and behaviours.\nThe trip was partially funded by Leszkiewicz’s current employer, Sherwood Scuba in Montreal, where he works as a sales representative for the scuba diving products company.\nTrue to his European roots, Leszkiewicz suited up for the Concordia Stingers men’s soccer team for the 2008-09 season. “I’m as passionate of soccer as I am of sharks, so it was a privilege to represent my school with varsity sports,” he says.\nKnee injuries ended his varsity sports career yet have not hampered his passion for marine discovery. Now back in Montreal, Leszkiewicz recently embarked on another shark-filled adventure — this one a bit more under wraps.\nWhat is it? “I cannot speak about it much,” he said just before he left. “As soon as I can, I will let you know!”\n#CUalumni\n"}

That’s why we went into science,” he says.\nBiot-Pelletier and Vallerand are both working on yeast-related projects in Vincent Martin ’s lab. Martin is the Concordia University Research Chair in Microbial Engineering and Synthetic Biology.\nVallerand is working on engineering yeast to use methanol as an energy source, while Biot-Pelletier is looking at identifying more sustainable sources of sugar for yeast to feed on rather than food crops,\nSoftware for solving problems\nBoth students began teaching themselves how to code in order to more rapidly advance their work. Relying on software and equation libraries has limited impact, Biot-Pelletier says: “Sometimes you need to solve a problem that no one before you has solved, in which case you’ll need to write your own software.”\nThat’s where Python for Scientific Concordians comes in.\nThe workshop series begins May 16 with guest lecturer Darren Platt , head of data science at American biotechnology firm Amyris, who will shed light on why computers and biology make good bedfellows.\nA natural programmer who kept computer science as a backup plan in case biology didn’t work out, Platt says he didn’t have the patience for academia and lab work. “I really like building things that people use, and I can point to the impact,” he says.\nAmyris makes malaria medication , industrial lubricants, renewable jet fuel and materials used in cosmetics — namely squalene, historically cultivated from shark livers and now a plant-derived, biodegradable ingredient. “Anything nature can make you can make in yeast if you engineer it,” Platt says.\nEngineered yeast holds a lot of biomedical and biotechnological promise, but it requires intensive computing, Platt says — first, to design the desired yeast, and then to test it and collect resulting data. This is where Platt, who is also a trained biologist, shines.\nStrong interest so far\nIf registrations are a marker of interest, the seven-week workshop is bound to make waves: More than 100 people have already registered, which is free thanks to funding from the Concordia School of Graduate Studies . Platt’s introductory lecture — which is open to the public — will help set the context and make the case for computational biology. The subsequent weekly sessions will be taught by different professors from Concordia, McGill and Génome Québec.\n“I hope that with this workshop and the fact that we’ve had 100 subscriptions in 10 days, the university realizes this is something people are interested in and hopefully it can become a program in the future for students to take,” Vallerand says.\n \nDarren Platt’s lecture, “The Future of Computation in Biology,” on May 16 from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE-110) on Loyola Campus, is free and open to the public. Subsequent workshops are on a registration basis .\n \n"}

Indeed, it has been said that the ability to slow the ageing process would be the most important medical discovery in the modern era.\nA new study published in the journal Oncotarget by researchers from Concordia and the Quebec-based biotech company Idunn Technologies may have uncovered an important factor: plant extracts containing the six best groups of anti-ageing molecules ever seen.\nFor the study, the research team combed through Idunn Technologies’ extensive biological library, conducting more than 10,000 trials to screen for plant extracts that would increase the chronological lifespan of yeast.\nWhy yeast? Cellularly speaking, ageing progresses similarly in both yeast and humans. It’s the best cellular model to understand how the anti-ageing process takes place.\n“In total, we found six new groups of molecules that decelerate the chronological ageing of yeast,” says Vladimir Titorenko , the study’s senior author and a professor in the Department of Biology at Concordia.\nHe carried out the study with a group of Concordia students and Éric Simard, the founder of Idunn Technologies, which is named for the goddess of rejuvenation in Norse mythology.\nThis has important implications not only for slowing the ageing process, but also for preventing certain diseases associated with ageing, including cancer.\n“Rather than focus on curing the individual disease, interventions on the molecular processes of ageing can simultaneously delay the onset and progression of most age-related disorders,” says Simard, who notes that these new molecules will soon be available in commercial products.\n“This kind of intervention is predicted to have a much larger effect on healthy ageing and life expectancy than can be attained by treating individual diseases.\"\n“These results also provide new insights into mechanisms through which chemicals extracted from certain plants can slow biological ageing,” says Titorenko.\nAn extract of willow bark has shown to be one of the most potent longevity-extending pharmacological interventions yet described in scientific literature.\nOne of these groups of molecules is the most potent longevity-extending pharmacological intervention yet described in scientific literature: a specific extract of  willow bark .\nWillow bark was commonly used during the time of Hippocrates, when people were advised to chew on it to relieve pain and fever. The study showed that it increases the average and maximum chronological lifespan of yeast by 475 per cent and 369 per cent, respectively. This represents a much greater effect than rapamycin and metformin, the two best drugs known for their anti-ageing effects.\n“These six extracts have been recognized as non-toxic by Health Canada, and already exhibit recognized health benefits in humans,” says Simard.\n“But first, more research must be done. That’s why Idunn Technologies is collaborating with four other universities for six research programs, to go beyond yeast, and work with an animal model of ageing, as well as two cancer models.”\nPartners in research: This study was supported in part by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies, the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship Award, the Concordia University Chair Fund and the Concordia University Undergraduate Research Award.\nThe co-authors of this study are Vicky Lutchman, Younes Medkour, Eugenie Samson, Anthony Arlia-Ciommo, Pamela Dakik, Berly Cortes, Rachel Feldman, Sadaf Mohtashami, Mélissa McAuley, Marisa Chancharoen, Belise Rukundo and Vladimir I.

This is because every one of the 3 billion or so cells that make up you recycles biomaterials. To do so, they use specialized tiny organs or organelles called lysosomes. Lysosomes are an essential source of nutrients for cells and they breakdown toxic biomaterials that accumulate in cells as they age. As such, progressive loss of lysosome function is thought to contribute to aging and ultimately death. Lysosomes require 3 processes to function: (1) membrane fusion to receive incoming biomaterials, (2) biomaterial catabolism by lumenal hydrolyses, and (3) nutrient transport by transporter proteins that return products of catabolism (amino acids, sugars, lipids) to the cell. My lab studies the molecular underpinnings of lysosome membrane fusion and nutrient transport. We discovered that during membrane fusion, a portion of the lysosome membrane is internalized and catabolized. Lysosomal transporter proteins are selectively sorted into this area and degraded offering lysosomes a mechanism to to clear damaged transporter proteins or remodel themselves when necessary. This process, which we named the \"ILF pathway\" seems to be critical for lysosome function when cells are starved or as they age. As my lab continues to study the contributions of ILF pathway to lysosome biology, I aim to translate state-of-the-art knowledge into new strategies to promote longevity and treat age-related diseases.\nTeaching activities\n"}

Can Christopher Plenzich’s research video win NSERC's national award?", "text": "Graduate student Christopher Plenzich is in the running for NSERC's Science, Action! video prize\nPosted on March 14, 2016\n|\nBy: Tom Peacock\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\nChristopher Plenzich, a master’s student in Biology, recently submitted a video to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Science Action! Video Contest .\nThe one-minute film, called En Masse, shows forest tent caterpillars on the hunt for food. Plenzich is encouraging people to watch it because the 15 submissions with the most views will make it to the final round. The winners of Science Action! will be determined by a panel of judges.\nWe asked Plenzich about how he became interested in his chosen research topic.\n‘The caterpillars began to grow on me.’\nChristopher Plenzich: It all began three years ago when I was looking for a master's supervisor. I contacted Emma Despland and met with her. I was offered a position to work with these caterpillars.\nAdmittedly, I was completely lost when I began my research. I had just finished my undergrad in environmental sciences and was looking for a change, and I did not have much training in biology.\nIt took some time, but after spending every day alone with the caterpillars, they began to grow on me. Fast-forward to three years later, and I've almost completed my master's with them, and had a very successful art exhibit in collaboration with Alison Reiko Loader.\nWas your decision to enter the contest inspired by your collaboration?\nCP: Yes it was! The footage I used for the video entry came from what I shot with Alison Reiko Loader for our En Masse exhibit. I thought it was just another interesting and different way to portray my master's research. The footage was shot in collaboration with Alison.\nWhere are you at right now with your research? \nCP: I'm finishing up. I actually hope to submit my thesis by the end of the week and schedule a defense date!\nIn the video, you conclude that your findings could have positive implications for forest managers. Can you elaborate?\nThe forest tent caterpillar is an outbreaking species. This means that at times, their population can be really low, and at other times, their population peaks in forests, which can cause damage to trees because the caterpillars must constantly eat to sustain their transformation into a moth (since they can't eat as a moth because they emerge with a non-functional mouth).\nThe mechanisms that cause an outbreak are complex, so the more we know about the caterpillar behaviour, the better we can predict and mitigate any negative effects they cause.\nWhat my research found is that when these caterpillars are eating leaves that are not optimally nutritious, they would rather leave the safety of their colony and venture out and perhaps find better quality food, but risk encountering a predator.\nAlso, social caterpillars, like the forest tent caterpillar, make great models to study group behaviour because they are easily manageable and there has been quite a bit of research done on them.\nSo, by extrapolating the findings from these caterpillars to other larger animals, we can get a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how animals groups are formed and how they disperse.\nFind out more about the Department of Biology .\n \nThumbnail by Greg Hume via Wikimedia Commons.\n \n"}

Weladji examines the fallout\nPosted on February 25, 2016\n|\nBy: Rosalyn Roxborough\nIt’s called the  “Cecil effect” and it complicates the moral conversation around big-game hunting in Africa.\nWhen Cecil the lion was killed for sport in Zimbabwe last July by American dentist Walter Palmer, there was a global outcry — after all, Cecil was part of a research program funded by the University of Oxford in England.\n \nThis outrage over Cecil's death sparked a backlash against legal big-game hunting safaris .\nA subsequent fallout of the affair — the so-called \"Cecil effect\" — has been a drop in legal trophy hunting and an overpopulation of lions in Zimbabwe. The Bubye Valley Conservancy, the country's largest wildlife area, may have to cull as many as 200 of the large cats as the cost to relocate even one is prohibitive.\n“People are very sensitive about Cecil’s death, which was tragic, but it’s not so simple,” says Robert B. Weladji , an associate professor in Concordia’s Department of Biology and associate researcher with the Zoo de Granby .\nAs an ecologist concerned with conservation, Weladji must consider how the Cecil effect will impact the ecosystem.\n“If you let the higher trophic level of the food chain — top predators like lions — grow uncontrolled in population, that has a serious effect on the lower trophic levels, the herbivores,” explains Weladji.\n“It can be disastrous in terms of ecosystem functioning. Lions give birth to up to four cubs and have a shorter gestation length, so they reproduce at a faster rate than most herbivores of their size, and they don’t have natural predators. That’s why legal hunting is not always killing for killing’s sake. It’s one way to manage the ecosystem, in this case the Bubye Valley Conservancy.”\nA tourism draught\nFor a relatively poor country like Zimbabwe, Weladji adds, the economic consequences are equally extreme.\nCNBC reported that in 2013, the safari and big-game hunting sector accounted for more than 10 per cent of the country's GDP, with a direct contribution of $71 billion, nearly double the global average on a percentage basis.\nZimbabwe’s tourism professionals sounded the alarm bell as early as July 30, 2015, just a month after Cecil’s death.\n\"Our tourism sector, which was booming, has recorded a significant drop in arrivals in the Hwange National Park, where Cecil was being kept,” Zimbabwe Tourism Authority Chief Executive Karikoga Kaseke told USA Today , without giving exact figures.\n“The culprits have painted Zimbabwe with a dirty brush. We are now seen as people who do not promote and protect animal rights.”\nWeladji is sympathetic to Kaseke and Zimbabwe’s current public relations nightmare, saying that it's important to consider how the hunting revenue was being managed.\n“Ask yourself, ‘Was part of the income from wildlife safaris being reinvested in conservation?’” says Weladji, who cites a February 2016 study in Trends in Ecology & Evolution to that effect.\n“If the money dries up, how will they hire park game wardens, buy cars for anti-poaching units and pay for animal tracking? The whole conservation effort is jeopardized. That’s where the disaster occurs.”\nBut there’s another negative consequence of lion overpopulation that most coverage of the Cecil effect hasn't mentioned.\n“More people and livestock will be killed by lions,” says Weladji. “That’s what happens when there’s no easy access to prey.\n“Local people living near protected areas, as well as their livestock, are easy prey. You can’t let the top predators increase, unchecked, without decimating the herbivores and causing a dysfunctional ecosystem.”\nRead about Concordia professor Robert B. Weladji's  research at the Zoo de Granby .\n \n"}

In one program, we investigate cell cycle control and development in Candida albicans, one of the most common fungal pathogens of humans. C. albicans differentiates into several cell types, including yeast, pseudohyphae or hyphae. This trait is crucial for virulence; cells locked in one form are significantly less pathogenic. Cell cycle signals have profound effects on differentiation and polar morphogenesis in C. albicans, but the basic cell cycle circuitry and mechanisms linking it with development are not well defined. We specifically investigate regulatory aspects of the G1/S transition, mitosis and polar morphogenesis. Our work revealed distinct features that have important implications for new drug target discovery and controlling growth of the pathogen. In a second program, we focus on the roles of a polo-like kinase, PLKA, in cell cycle regulation and development of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Polo-like kinases are multi-functional cell cycle regulators in yeast to humans, up-regulated in many cancers, and play additional roles in metazoan development. We identified PLKA in A. nidulans, which is the only filamentous fungal polo-like kinase characterized to date, and demonstrated that it has many novel functions, including negatively regulating sexual development. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that filamentous fungal polo-like kinases are a distinct group, which has important implications for the evolution of the polo-like kinase family.\nAccepting graduate students: Please forward a C.V. and provide names of references\nTeaching activities\nBiotechnology and Genomics Lab (Diploma Program in Genomics)\nSelected publications\nMogilevsky,  K.*, Glory, A.* and Bachewich, C.  2012.

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

Limited tolerance to extremes in temperatures, drought, salinity and nutrient imbalances have traditionally restricted the cropping alternatives available to growers and threatened the sustainability of agriculture. Understanding the genetic basis of environmental stress tolerance and genetic improvement of crop species can enhance productivity, expand crop production into previously non-economically viable areas and reduce the need for expensive inputs with possible environmentally damaging consequences. Many plant species show remarkable tolerance to environmental stresses, including high salinity, drought and temperatures below -20°C. The molecular analysis of the plant's response to drought, salt stress, and freezing have shown that there is a large number of genes that are up-regulated in response to these stresses. Some of stress-responsive genes are regulated by common signalling pathways that act in response to different stresses and others are regulated by pathways that are unique to specific stresses. Many of the stress-regulated genes are themselves regulatory genes. We study the adaptation to environmental stress in wheat, Triticum aestivum, one of the most important crops world-wide. We carry out both molecular analysis of stress-regulated genes and genomic analysis of the stress response for large-scale gene discovery. Our current work focuses on signalling pathways that are mediated by the interaction of GTP binding proteins (G proteins), calcium binding proteins and phospholipase C's. These stress regulated genes encoding these proteins initially were discovered in wheat, and in a closely related and highly salt-tolerant wild wheatgrass Lophopyrum elongatum. To further characterize the effects of these genes on plant growth and resistance to environmental stress we characterize the homologs of the cereal genes in Arabidopsis lines in which the genes have been mutated or over-expressed.\nOur second major area of research is in genomic research of wheat and closely related species in the tribe Triticeae. We characterize expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from large-scale first and second generation sequencing of cDNA. Gene discovery is directed toward the identification of signalling and regulatory genes whose expression is induced or repressed by environmental stress and the characterization of homeologous gene expression in polyploidy plants.\nTeaching activities\nMolecular and General Genetics\nSelected publications\nKhalil, H.B., Brunetti, S.C., Pham, U.M., Maret, D., Laroche, A., Gulick, P.J.

The aims of my research are focused upon using techniques in synthetic biology as a means of exploiting enzymes, developing them as tools in industrial biocatalysis, as well as targeting them within pathogenic microbes to disable them with specific inhibitor drugs as therapeutics to treat infectious diseases.\nEnzyme engineering\nUsing techniques like directed evolution, we can engineer enzymes to optimize them towards our desired activities by mimicking the natural selection process in the laboratory. To this end we are pursuing research towards discovering and engineering enzyme biocatalysts for the production of anticancer anthracycline glycoside drugs and other therapeutic drugs from the same class of natural products for use in a wide range of health applications. We also aim to establish, using synthetic biology, new methods for producing biorenewable hydrocarbons as alternatives to petroleum products and to engineer, through directed evolution, efficient enzyme biocatalysts for doing so.\nScreening enzyme inhibitors as antimicrobial drugs\nWe aim to develop and apply high-throughput enzyme activity-based methods for discovering drugs against Mycobacteria tuberculosis using an in vitro reconstituted biosynthetic pathway of mycobacterial cell wall components by which to assay enzyme inhibitors.\nOpportunities\nStudents interested in research positions in our lab, please email a C.V. and provide the names and contact information of references\nPublications\nKwan, D.H., Jin, Y., Jiang, J., Chen, H.M., Kötzler, M.P., Overkleeft, H.S., Davies, G.J., and Withers, S.G.

Microorganisms, in particular fungi, are efficient decomposers of plant biomass. They produce extracellular enzymes to breakdown plant biomass. We use genomic and ancillary approaches to identify novel enzymes involved in lignocellulose hydrolysis. Our research includes: 1) sequencing and analysis of thermophilic fungi and wood-rotting fungi; 2) examine the transcriptome and exo-proteome profiles of these fungi to identify promising lignocellulolytic proteins; 3) produce recombinant proteins using the industrial workhorse Aspergillus niger; 4) determine the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzymes; and 5) in collaboration with industrial and government partners, test the enzymes for industrial and environmental applications. Data management and development of computational tools are integral parts of our research. Other research interests include biocuration, phylogenomics, developmental of sustainable biotechnology and cell differentiation.\nSelected publications\nBadhan A, Jin L, Wang Y, Han S, Kowalczys K, Brown DC, Ayala CJ, Latoszek-Green M, Miki B, Tsang A, McAllister T.

First, our laboratory is investigating biochemical and molecular aspects of the sulfonation reaction in relation to plant growth, development and adaptation to stress using Arabidopsis thaliana sulfotransferases as a model system. To date, we have characterized two sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of brassinosteroids and hydroxylated derivatives of jasmonic acid, respectively. The biochemical function and the pattern of expression of these enzymes suggest that plants like mammals use the sulfonation reaction to modulate the biological activity of hormones and chemical messengers. Our second axis of research is the study of the structure function relationship of sulfotransferases in order to elucidate the mechanism of sulfonate transfer and to define the amino acids responsible for substrate binding and catalysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, we mapped several amino acids required for catalysis and cosubstrate binding while the construction of chimeric proteins allowed to define the domain responsible for substrate specificity.\nTeaching activities\n"}

Currently, we are focused on several interconnected research themes:\nMonitoring, modeling and predicting microbial community dynamics. A general goal in microbial ecology is to predict the response of microbial systems to external disturbances, for example, a warming climate. Currently, predictions are hindered by an incomplete understanding of how environmental and biotic factors influence microbial community structure and function. In the Walsh lab, we are using the coastal ocean as a model ecosystem in which to advance microbial ecology towards a predictive science. We are monitoring the composition of microbial assemblages in relation to a long-term, high resolution oceanographic time-series of abiotic and biotic conditions at a temperate coastal ocean observatory. Through repeated observation over multiple years, we are identifying re-occurring patterns in microbial genetic and functional diversity that will inform the construction of ecological models of coastal microbial systems.\nReconciling diversity: organic matter and microbial communities. Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration. Although a natural phenomenon, evidence points to human-driven expansion of hypoxia in both the coastal and open ocean. Oxygen depletion in the open ocean is intensifying, potentially driven by current climate trends. Similarly, excess nutrient input from industrial and agricultural activities are leading to an increase in the number of coastal hypoxic regions. We are investigating the causes and consequences of marine hypoxia from a microbial ecology perspective by studying microbial communities associated with hypoxic bottom waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and several coastal marine basins.\nCauses and consequences of marine hypoxia.\nOxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration.

These compounds are important for plant development and its interaction with the environment, as well as of potential benefits to human health.

At the same time, parasites are organisms in their own right and are subject to many of the same environmental pressures that affect free living organisms. Research in this laboratory is focussed primarily on the trematode (fluke) and cestode (tapeworm) parasites of aquatic birds. Our approach is mainly ecological in it's perspective and involves studies the effects of temporal and spatial parameters on parasite communities in wild ducks, gulls and coots. The most recent study is on the seasonal dynamics of parasites in eider ducks in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. In addition to studies on the parasites in birds, we also work on projects that explore various aspects of parasite life cycles, seasonal dynamics of parasites in snail and arthropod intermediate hosts and on host-parasite relations between parasite larvae and the intermediate hosts. This has included studies on the seasonal transmission of two trematodes (Cyclocoelum and Diplostomum ) in laboratory and natural conditions and aspects of the host parasite -relationship between cestode larvae and crustacean intermediate hosts. Because birds are hosts to a tremendous diversity of parasitic worms, a significant part of the work in this laboratory involves the identification of parasite species. While much of this is done using traditional morphological methods, we also use molecular methods in studies designed to clarify relationships between morphologically similar species, to identify potentially pathogenic parasite larvae and to investigate the phylogenetic history of members of selected families of cyclophyllidean cestodes.\nSelected publications\nDesilets, H.

Prior to this he held his first post doctoral fellowship at the August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), where he also taught in the Department of Cell Biology. He received a PhD in Medical Physiology from Lund University (Sweden) and has a strong background in molecular biology and protein chemistry after studies at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund University (MSc., Chemical Engineering).\nEducation\nPhD (Lund University), MSc (Lund University)\nResearch interests\nThe main research interests in Dr Bergdahl’s lab lies in studies of the blood vessel wall with a focus on understanding this system during physiologically stressful situations like exercise as well as pathophysiological conditions. The differentiation and functional properties of smooth muscle cells depend on the cellular environment, and any disturbance of this, such as endothelial damage, inflammation or lipid retention will lead to reactions that can initiate atherosclerotic lesions. Dr Bergdahl study mechanisms involved in these processes by using state-of-the-art techniques including electrophysiology, isometric force measurements, functional proteomics, molecular genetics and advanced imaging. The overriding goal is to define conditions that are essential for the normal function and cell differentiation in the vascular wall and to translate these findings from the basic understanding and experimental animal research into clinical understanding of integrative cardiovascular control in health and disease. This is hoped to generate new therapeutic approaches which in the future might lead to better prevention of vascular disease.\nTeaching activities\n"}

The main project called \"Hormonal regulation of T cell Genomics.\", is meant to investigate how the catecholamine hormone receptors (e.g. beta2-adrenergic receptor) influence T lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Other hormones of interest include thyroid hormones and cortisol. A second project called \"Human variations in sympathetic nervous system response.\" was recently launched to address the hypothesis that human autonomic traits are distributed around two theoretical groupings. For this project, human subjects listen to dissonant music or undergo cold exposure to induce autonomic reactions. A third initiative is in development to investigate the impact of sodium on T lymphocyte responses in people. Dr. Darlington always encourages students to develop and pursue their own research interests within the themes of immunology and autonomic nervous system. The research happens in Canada at the PERFORM Centre and the Center for Structural and Functional Genomics at the Loyola Campus in NDG, Montreal, Quebec. \nPublications\nSelected publications\n1.      A.

I regularly teach Biochemistry I (CHEM271) and Biochemistry II (CHEM375). Biochemistry I is an introductory course and covers the basics of biochemistry including enzymology, protein structure and metabolism. Biochemistry II covers more of the specific biochemical reactions involved in metabolic pathways. I also teach Discovering Biotechnology (CHEM209) which is an introduction to the world of biotechnology for non-scientists. This course covers topics such as cloning and genetic engineering and includes discussions of the societal and ethical issues that are involved. In the past few years I have also taught graduate courses in Protein Targeting and Membrane Biochemistry.\nPublications\nRecent publications\nChakraborty PK, Schmitz-Abe K, Kennedy EK, Mamady H, Naas T, Durie D, CampagnaDR, Lau A, Sendamarai AK, Wiseman DH, May A, Jolles S, Connor P, Powell C,Heeney MM, Giardina PJ, Klaassen RJ, Kannengiesser C, Thuret I, Thompson AA,Marques L, Hughes S, Bonney DK, Bottomley SS, Wynn RF, Laxer RM, Minniti CP,Moppett J, Bordon V, Geraghty M, Joyce PBM, Markianos K, Rudner AM, Holcik M,Fleming MD (2014) Mutations in TRNT1, encoding the CCA-adding enzyme, causecongenital sideroblastic anemia with B cell immunodeficiency, periodic feversand developmental delay (SIFD).

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst.\nThorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes.\nWe are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions.\nThe biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution.\nWhy study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.\nRecent publications\nS.

Road effects model for predicting when animal populations are at risk from roads: an interactive model of road avoidance behaviour\n- Click here to start the model -\nRoads and traffic affect animal populations detrimentally in four ways: they decrease habitat amount and quality, enhance mortality due to collisions with vehicles, prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and subdivide animal populations into smaller and more vulnerable fractions. Roads will affect persistence of animal populations differently depending on (1) road avoidance behavior of the animals (i.e., noise avoidance, road surface avoidance, and car avoidance); (2) population sensitivity to the four road effects; (3) road size; and (4) traffic volume. We have created a model based on these population and road characteristics to study the questions: (1) what types of road avoidance behaviors make populations more vulnerable to roads?; (2) what types of roads have the greatest impact on population persistence?; and (3) how much does the impact of roads vary with the relative population sensitivity to the four road effects?\nOur results suggest that, in general, the most vulnerable populations are those with high noise and high road surface avoidance, and secondly, those with high noise avoidance only. Conversely, the least vulnerable populations are those with high car avoidance only, and secondly, high road surface and high car avoidance. Populations with low overall road avoidance and those with high overall road avoidance tend to respond in opposite ways when the sensitivity to the four road effects is varied. The same is true of populations with high road surface avoidance when compared to those with high car and high noise avoidance. The model further predicted that traffic volume has a larger effect than road size on the impact of roads on population persistence. One potential application of our model is to generate predictions for more structured field studies of road avoidance behavior and its influence on persistence of wildlife populations.\nPublished in Jaeger et al.

What are the objectives of environmental science?\nDr. Martin Scheringer and I want to start a critical discussion of this question. Therefore, we investigate the kinds of research questions asked by environmental scientists. To do this, we are taking a closer look at four questions:\nWhat is the lack of knowledge to be addressed by the research?\nWhat is the purpose of the results?\nWhat are the subjects the research is dealing with?\nWhat are the methods chosen for the investigation?\nWe propose that problem-oriented environmental science should strive to find answers to these questions that are different from those offered by ‘classical’ natural sciences.\nThe reason is that in the treatment of environmental problems, there is often a discrepancy between the needs of dicision makers and the results provided by scientific research (what we call the “datadilemma”). To explore how this discrepancy could be reduced, we make a distinction between knowledge-oriented and decision-oriented reduction of complexity. The challenge that today's environmental research is facing is that decision-oriented reduction of complexity should be incorporated in the selection of scientific problems. We use the guiding principle of “reflexive environmental research” and point out how it differs from the guiding principles of “classical scientific research”. Its key elements are: reflection of guiding ideas external to science (e.g., sustainability); addressing explicitly the uncertainty and openness of scientific results and forecasts (including unknown unknowns); transdisciplinarity; the aim of contributing to the solution of complex and controversial real-world problems; adherence to relevant scientific standards.\nYou find more information and you are invited to contribute to the discussion here: www.env-science.ethz.ch\n9.

Students transferring from the MSc program will be required to complete 90 credits in addition to the course requirements for the Master’s program (9 credits). Students may be required to take up to 12 credits, at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level, in addition to the above. These courses may be required to strengthen understanding of peripheral areas or of the student’s area of specialization. The additional course work may be assigned as an admission requirement or following the Research Proposal and Qualifying Exam (BIOL 850).\nResidence. The minimum residence requirement is two years (6 terms) of full-time study beyond the master’s degree, or three years (9 terms) of full-time study beyond the bachelor’s degree.\nCourses. To graduate, students must meet the following requirements:\n3 credits from BIOL 616, BIOL 670, BIOL 671 or any of the Advanced Topics or Reading Courses listed at the end of the Biology calendar entry. Other courses in the list may be chosen upon recommendation of the supervisory committee and the Graduate Program Director.\nBIOL 801: Pedagogical training (3 credits). Candidates are required to give four lectures (normally 75 minutes each) to undergraduate classes. Two lectures are in introductory level courses and two in advanced undergraduate courses. Tutorials are provided to introduce students to teaching methods. The course is marked on a pass/fail basis.\nBIOL 802: Research seminar (3 credits). Students are required to give one seminar to the Department based upon their research project. Normally the seminar is given in the second or third years of residency. Seminars are graded on a standard scale (A+ to F). The grade is based upon the presentation, content, and the student’s ability to answer questions. The grade is assigned by the Graduate Program Director in consultation with the candidate’s supervisory committee and other faculty members present at the seminar.\nBIOL 850: Research proposal and qualifying exam (6 credits). The student prepares a written research proposal based upon the research topic chosen for thesis research. The proposal is prepared in consultation with the supervisory committee and contains a literature review, a progress report and a detailed description of future experiments. The proposal should demonstrate a good understanding of the background of the project, the questions to be answered, and the experimental approaches needed to answer these questions. Both the written proposal and an oral summary of the proposal are presented to the examining committee within one year of entry into the PhD program.\nBIOL 890: Research and thesis (75 credits).\nResearch Proposal and Qualifying Exam. The examining committee consists of the student’s supervisory committee plus two additional members of the Department of Biology and is chaired by the Graduate Program Director. The student is evaluated on the basis of the quality of the oral and written presentations of the proposal and on responses to questions from the examining committee. These questions extend into general areas as well as focusing directly on the thesis topic. The examining committee assigns one of the following three grades:\nPASS: The student is admitted to candidacy for a PhD in Biology.\nCONDITIONAL PASS: The student is admitted to candidacy but is required to complete at least one additional course. This grade is assigned only if the background preparation of the student is judged to be insufficient.\nFAIL: The student must withdraw from the program.\nIf the examining committee judges that the proposal has weaknesses that can be corrected with minor revisions, it may suspend assigning a mark for a period not exceeding three months. The revised proposal then is assigned one of the three above grades.\nThesis. A major portion of the PhD program involves the planning and execution of innovative and original research under the direction of a supervisor. It is expected that this research should result in publication in reputable journals, on which the candidate is the first author and the major contributor of ideas and experimental data. The thesis will be examined by a Thesis Examining Committee and will be defended orally.\nAdmission requirements\nAdmission Requirements. Applicants should have an MSc degree in life sciences and will be assessed by the departmental Graduate Studies Committee on the basis of undergraduate and graduate grades, letters of reference and research ability. Applicants should have at least a B average overall. Prior to final acceptance, the student must have a thesis supervisor chosen by mutual agreement among the student, the Graduate Studies Committee and the potential supervisor. Students will normally be accepted only for full-time study. Students with a Master’s degree from a foreign university will normally not be directly admitted into the PhD program, but will be accepted into the Master of/Magisteriate in Biology program. They will, however, on demonstration of the ability to complete a PhD, be eligible to transfer to a PhD as described below.\nStudents registered in the Master of/Magisteriate in Science in Biology who demonstrate exceptional potential for independent research and have attained an A- average in graduate courses in the program may request to transfer to the PhD program during the first six months of the second year of enrolment. The transfer must be approved by the student’s supervisory committee and the departmental Graduate Studies Committee.\n"}

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine ‘how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions’. Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey.\nMy long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

In one program, we investigate cell cycle control and development in Candida albicans, one of the most common fungal pathogens of humans. C. albicans differentiates into several cell types, including yeast, pseudohyphae or hyphae. This trait is crucial for virulence; cells locked in one form are significantly less pathogenic. Cell cycle signals have profound effects on differentiation and polar morphogenesis in C. albicans, but the basic cell cycle circuitry and mechanisms linking it with development are not well defined. We specifically investigate regulatory aspects of the G1/S transition, mitosis and polar morphogenesis. Our work revealed distinct features that have important implications for new drug target discovery and controlling growth of the pathogen. In a second program, we focus on the roles of a polo-like kinase, PLKA, in cell cycle regulation and development of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Polo-like kinases are multi-functional cell cycle regulators in yeast to humans, up-regulated in many cancers, and play additional roles in metazoan development. We identified PLKA in A. nidulans, which is the only filamentous fungal polo-like kinase characterized to date, and demonstrated that it has many novel functions, including negatively regulating sexual development. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that filamentous fungal polo-like kinases are a distinct group, which has important implications for the evolution of the polo-like kinase family.\nAccepting graduate students: Please forward a C.V. and provide names of references\nTeaching activities\nBiotechnology and Genomics Lab (Diploma Program in Genomics)\nSelected publications\nMogilevsky,  K.*, Glory, A.* and Bachewich, C.  2012.

Lysosomes require 3 processes to function: (1) membrane fusion to receive incoming biomaterials, (2) biomaterial catabolism by lumenal hydrolyses, and (3) nutrient transport by transporter proteins that return products of catabolism (amino acids, sugars, lipids) to the cell. My lab studies the molecular underpinnings of lysosome membrane fusion and nutrient transport. We discovered that during membrane fusion, a portion of the lysosome membrane is internalized and catabolized. Lysosomal transporter proteins are selectively sorted into this area and degraded offering lysosomes a mechanism to to clear damaged transporter proteins or remodel themselves when necessary. This process, which we named the \"ILF pathway\" seems to be critical for lysosome function when cells are starved or as they age. As my lab continues to study the contributions of ILF pathway to lysosome biology, I aim to translate state-of-the-art knowledge into new strategies to promote longevity and treat age-related diseases.\nTeaching activities\n"}

The aims of my research are focused upon using techniques in synthetic biology as a means of exploiting enzymes, developing them as tools in industrial biocatalysis, as well as targeting them within pathogenic microbes to disable them with specific inhibitor drugs as therapeutics to treat infectious diseases.\nEnzyme engineering\nUsing techniques like directed evolution, we can engineer enzymes to optimize them towards our desired activities by mimicking the natural selection process in the laboratory. To this end we are pursuing research towards discovering and engineering enzyme biocatalysts for the production of anticancer anthracycline glycoside drugs and other therapeutic drugs from the same class of natural products for use in a wide range of health applications. We also aim to establish, using synthetic biology, new methods for producing biorenewable hydrocarbons as alternatives to petroleum products and to engineer, through directed evolution, efficient enzyme biocatalysts for doing so.\nScreening enzyme inhibitors as antimicrobial drugs\nWe aim to develop and apply high-throughput enzyme activity-based methods for discovering drugs against Mycobacteria tuberculosis using an in vitro reconstituted biosynthetic pathway of mycobacterial cell wall components by which to assay enzyme inhibitors.\nOpportunities\nStudents interested in research positions in our lab, please email a C.V. and provide the names and contact information of references\nPublications\nKwan, D.H., Jin, Y., Jiang, J., Chen, H.M., Kötzler, M.P., Overkleeft, H.S., Davies, G.J., and Withers, S.G.

Microorganisms, in particular fungi, are efficient decomposers of plant biomass. They produce extracellular enzymes to breakdown plant biomass. We use genomic and ancillary approaches to identify novel enzymes involved in lignocellulose hydrolysis. Our research includes: 1) sequencing and analysis of thermophilic fungi and wood-rotting fungi; 2) examine the transcriptome and exo-proteome profiles of these fungi to identify promising lignocellulolytic proteins; 3) produce recombinant proteins using the industrial workhorse Aspergillus niger; 4) determine the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzymes; and 5) in collaboration with industrial and government partners, test the enzymes for industrial and environmental applications. Data management and development of computational tools are integral parts of our research. Other research interests include biocuration, phylogenomics, developmental of sustainable biotechnology and cell differentiation.\nSelected publications\nBadhan A, Jin L, Wang Y, Han S, Kowalczys K, Brown DC, Ayala CJ, Latoszek-Green M, Miki B, Tsang A, McAllister T.

Currently, we are focused on several interconnected research themes:\nMonitoring, modeling and predicting microbial community dynamics. A general goal in microbial ecology is to predict the response of microbial systems to external disturbances, for example, a warming climate. Currently, predictions are hindered by an incomplete understanding of how environmental and biotic factors influence microbial community structure and function. In the Walsh lab, we are using the coastal ocean as a model ecosystem in which to advance microbial ecology towards a predictive science. We are monitoring the composition of microbial assemblages in relation to a long-term, high resolution oceanographic time-series of abiotic and biotic conditions at a temperate coastal ocean observatory. Through repeated observation over multiple years, we are identifying re-occurring patterns in microbial genetic and functional diversity that will inform the construction of ecological models of coastal microbial systems.\nReconciling diversity: organic matter and microbial communities. Oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration. Although a natural phenomenon, evidence points to human-driven expansion of hypoxia in both the coastal and open ocean. Oxygen depletion in the open ocean is intensifying, potentially driven by current climate trends. Similarly, excess nutrient input from industrial and agricultural activities are leading to an increase in the number of coastal hypoxic regions. We are investigating the causes and consequences of marine hypoxia from a microbial ecology perspective by studying microbial communities associated with hypoxic bottom waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and several coastal marine basins.\nCauses and consequences of marine hypoxia.\nOxygen deficiency (hypoxia) occurs in marine regions where high productivity fuels intense microbial respiration.

We use an array of genetic and  genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicans functions. As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international  research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome.  We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and  ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have  identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic  pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of the C. albicans cell cycle, and  investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system. We are also screening an  extensive library of conditional C.  albicans mutants using various physiological and chemical treatments  through the functional Genomics robotic facility at Concordia.

Limited tolerance to extremes in temperatures, drought, salinity and nutrient imbalances have traditionally restricted the cropping alternatives available to growers and threatened the sustainability of agriculture. Understanding the genetic basis of environmental stress tolerance and genetic improvement of crop species can enhance productivity, expand crop production into previously non-economically viable areas and reduce the need for expensive inputs with possible environmentally damaging consequences. Many plant species show remarkable tolerance to environmental stresses, including high salinity, drought and temperatures below -20°C. The molecular analysis of the plant's response to drought, salt stress, and freezing have shown that there is a large number of genes that are up-regulated in response to these stresses. Some of stress-responsive genes are regulated by common signalling pathways that act in response to different stresses and others are regulated by pathways that are unique to specific stresses. Many of the stress-regulated genes are themselves regulatory genes. We study the adaptation to environmental stress in wheat, Triticum aestivum, one of the most important crops world-wide. We carry out both molecular analysis of stress-regulated genes and genomic analysis of the stress response for large-scale gene discovery. Our current work focuses on signalling pathways that are mediated by the interaction of GTP binding proteins (G proteins), calcium binding proteins and phospholipase C's. These stress regulated genes encoding these proteins initially were discovered in wheat, and in a closely related and highly salt-tolerant wild wheatgrass Lophopyrum elongatum. To further characterize the effects of these genes on plant growth and resistance to environmental stress we characterize the homologs of the cereal genes in Arabidopsis lines in which the genes have been mutated or over-expressed.\nOur second major area of research is in genomic research of wheat and closely related species in the tribe Triticeae. We characterize expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from large-scale first and second generation sequencing of cDNA. Gene discovery is directed toward the identification of signalling and regulatory genes whose expression is induced or repressed by environmental stress and the characterization of homeologous gene expression in polyploidy plants.\nTeaching activities\nMolecular and General Genetics\nSelected publications\nKhalil, H.B., Brunetti, S.C., Pham, U.M., Maret, D., Laroche, A., Gulick, P.J.

The rates are primarily based on past use of the benefit by the participants in the plan.\nIn August 2016, you were notified that the premium rates for the 2016-2017 benefit year would be increasing, for the first time in four (4) years, by 20%.\nAt its November 2016 meeting, the Board of Governors approved a motion that the University will absorb the cost of the increase to Health Plan premiums for the 2016-2017 benefit year.\nThe change in the premium rates will be implemented on pay issued December 9, 2016. This means that those who have not paid the 2016-2017 premium rates in full will see a reduction in the rates for the balance of the year. For those who have paid in full, either through payroll deduction or by cheque, they will have the amount equal to the incremental increase in the health plan premium reimbursed on pay issued December 9, 2016.\nPlease bear in mind that in accordance with taxation laws, health plan premiums paid by the employer are taxable benefits. The incremental cost of the health care premiums absorbed by the University for the 2016-2017 benefit year will be an additional taxable benefit for employees.

Over course of the fall semester, students from Concordia University have returned to “the Point” for the third year to continue their community work in Pointe-Saint-Charles. The December 3rd event is open to the public and features exhibitions, research projects, and short performances.\nSchedule for the day\n2pm-3pm: Performances at Share the Warmth (625 rue Fortune)\n3pm-4pm: Curated walk through the neighbourhood\n4pm-5pm: Vernissage at Salon Laurette (1950 rue du Centre)\nEvents are free and all are welcome!\nUnder the banner of The Right to the City, three classes are discovering how learning with the city, and across disciplines, can enrich education while giving back to the community at large. Students in Art History, Theatre, and Art Education return to study in and with “the Point”, a traditionally working-class neighbourhood with a long history of community mobilization. Students have partnered with local organizations including the Atwater Library, the  Pointe-St-Charles YMCA ,  St-Columba House , and  Share the Warmth , among others. The project host is Share the Warmth/Partageons l’espoir, a citizen-led resource founded on the principles of social economy, education as a right, food justice, and community self-determination.\nThis unique platform for community-engaged learning allows Concordia’s students to better understand real issues facing Montrealers. The Right to the City offers an educational opportunity that is unique to Concordia; in learning from one another and with the community, students develop their critical thinking processes alongside their collaboration skills and sense of how to be engaged citizens.\n“We are pleased and grateful to return to Pointe-Saint-Charles for the final year of this project and to have a group of students who have been true ambassadors for Concordia,” says Dr Cynthia Hammond, the project leader. “It has been a pleasure to deepen our partnerships with these vital organizations, and to reconnect with the neighbourhood. Our students’ research and creative work help to show how learning can be reciprocal, a bridge between university and community.”\nThe Right to the City  project was made possible through a Curriculum Innovation grant from Concordia University. Dr Hammond, Associate Professor in Art History, has worked closely with co-instructors, Dr Edward Little, Chair of the Department of Theatre and founder of The Neighbourhood Theatre project, and Dr Kathleen Vaughan, Associate Professor in Art Education. The participants would like to thank  Concordia University , the  Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling ,  Share the Warmth , the  Atwater Library Digital Literacy Program ,  Salon Laurette , and  Sur la Well  for their support of this pedagogical initiative.\nFor more information please check out the  Facebook event page !\nWhere\n"}

Each of these things — along with every other organism on Earth — contains the molecular instructions for life, called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Encoded within this DNA are the directions for traits as diverse as the colour of a person’s eyes, the scent of a rose, and the way in which bacteria propagate to infect a lung cell.\nJust as DNA is found in nearly every living cell, can we imagine a future where even artificial objects encrypt a genetic code? This interactive exhibition presents a critical and somewhat subversive point of view on the world of objects, where the visitor is invited to manipulate distorted interactive objects, or play the role of a scientific investigator called on to discover the interior organs of an object, through hand held scanners and X-Rays.\nExposition :\nADN / La vie future des objets\nMartin Racine\nLe 31 octobre au 9 décembre 2016\nFR\nIssue d’un important projet collaboratif de recherche-création de trois ans subventionné par le FRQSC, cette exposition présente une réflexion sur la vie future des objets basée sur la métaphore d’un laboratoire de recherche spécialisé dans l’étude de l’ADN.\nQu’est-ce qu’un être humain, une rose et une bactérie ont en commun? Ils possèdent, à l’instar de tous les organismes de la Terre, les instructions moléculaires qui régulent la vie : l’ADN ou acide désoxyribonucléique. L’ADN encode les instructions qui déterminent des caractéristiques aussi variées que la couleur des yeux d’une personne, le parfum d’une rose ou le mode de propagation d’une bactérie infectant une cellule du poumon.\nPresque toutes les cellules vivantes contiennent de l’ADN. Pouvons-nous imaginer un avenir où même les objets artificiels auraient un code génétique? Cette exposition interactive propose une vision critique et quelque peu subversive du monde des objets.

Made in the UK between 1975-1978 while Marshall was teaching at Newcastle Polytechnic, these works reference Bruce Nauman's earlier Lip Sync from 1969, or the early video works of William Wegman. Parallel works Mouth Room and Arcanum illustrate Marshall's debt to feminist video practice and the 'semanalysis' theories of Julia Kristeva, with art as a signifying and re-signifying practice, as conveyed through Marshall's video theory in development at the same time. Retrospectively, Marshall's refrain of '...go through the motions of saying one thing and meaning another...' bespeaks the closet and the possibility of transformation. \"Go Through The Motions\" establishes the conceptual content and visual economy later explored by Marshall's \"Journal of the Plague Year\" and \"Pedagogue\".\n\"Pedagogue\", 1988, 11 min.\n\"Pedagogue\" is a 1988 collaboration between Stuart Marshall, author, playwright and performer Neil Bartlett (b.1958), and students at Newcastle Polytechnic. Marshall and Bartlett conceived Pedagogue as an improvised, agit-prop video to “cock a snook” at the Thatcher government's Section 28, in progress at the time. Section 28 was a repressive, homophobic legislation prohibiting the promotion of homosexual lifestyles that tried to turn the tide on two decades of LGBT political gains. By seeking to expose the absurdity of Section 28 Pedagogue humorously evokes the cultural opposition to regressive homophobic and anti-sex attitudes of the Thatcher's Britain promulgated in the right-wing press during the AIDS crisis. As a contemporary account states this 'deconstructs the two establishment myths that homosexuality can be \"taught\" and is \"infectious,\" thereby returning to pedagogical and pathological ideas of homosexuality, first explored in \"Bright Eyes\". (Quote from Between Imagination and Reality, ICA 1990.)\n\"Bright Eyes\", 1984, 80 min.\n\"Bright Eyes\" was commissioned by and first broadcast on UK television's Channel 4 in December 1984 in the context of a virulently homophobic media response to the emergence of HIV/AIDS. Marshall's innovative and experimental video-essay charts the media depiction of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease within the long durée of homosexual stigmatization and pathologization. For Marshall this entails earlier attempted sexual reform movements, political repression, ongoing censorship and entrapment. As a history of the present \"Bright Eyes\" combines archival material, historical reenactment and agit-prop theatricality with interviews featuring those on the frontline of the UK and US AIDS crisis such as lesbian and gay activists, health workers and people with AIDS. At the time, Marshall's historical, political and cultural analysis, radical image-text juxtapositions and intertextuality broke the mould and demanded an ethical and political response from its viewers. Displaying polemical attitude, artistic flair and intellectual acuity, \"Bright Eyes\" set the tone for AIDS cultural activism and analysis and continues to resonate with ongoing representations of HIV/AIDS and LGBTQI issues.\nProgram 2 — 17h:\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\", 1991. 74 min.\n\"Over Our Dead Bodies\" is Marshall's follow-up to Bright Eyes commissioned by and broadcast through dedicated lesbian and gay magazine OUT on UK Television's Channel 4 in August 1991. Documenting the rise of US AIDS activism and the corresponding UK activist scene, Marshall features extensive interviews with members of ACT UP, QUEER NATION, their UK chapters and corresponding UK activist group OutRage! AIDS activist and OutRage co-founder Simon Watney maps out the US and UK scenes, while activist video by ACT UP and OutRage! members and affiliated groups demonstrates the step-change in the cultural and political self-articulation and self-determination of AIDS activism.\n\"Robert Marshall\", 1991, 10 min.\n\"Robert Marshall\", (filmed with the assistance of John Greyson) charts Stuart Marshall's journey to make a video and visit family in Canada. Here Marshall seeks out 8mm film footage of his earlier family life that includes his deceased father Robert, who died in the filmmaker's company during childhood. Marshall's Barthesian narrative is a eulogy to his father, a paean to the power of the moving image, an account of Marshall's alternative medical treatment for AIDS at the same time as offering a poignant reflection on mortality and memory. Influenced by the writings of the women's health movement and Susan Sontag's Illness As Metaphor Marshall states, 'I believe that one should take some control over one's own disease process.' As such, Robert Marshall parallels the work of UK artist Jo Spence, displaying a historically committed, materialist regard for ethical convictions and political content. These works ask who goes before and what comes after us, while remaining indicative of Marshall's singular and unfaded polemical, critical and artistic abilities.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nThis retrospective is an event in conjunction with the public lecture:\n\"Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism and the AIDS Crisis:\nLearning in a Public Medium \"\n"}

How can creative reuse help us to alleviate our ecological footprint?

Once fabrics are produced, garments or “end uses” are described. “End uses” can be developed to create beautiful fashion garments to everyday basic apparel. As a garment becomes mature and the product lifecycle expires, garments can be recycled back into fibres where the cycle is reborn and new concepts are developed.\nArt Hives’ Science Shop presents UrbanBodies : an exploration of what matters in our everyday lives and neighborhoods.

The subsequent objectives were: i) to reduce the initial concentration of carbon, nutrients, and color-forming substances compared to conventional treatment systems, ii) to investigate removal mechanisms in the new system under electric field, iii) to optimize the system by studying the relationship between various operating parameters. To achieve these objectives an innovative compact electro-anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EAnMBR) was designed and its high performance was researched in two operational configurations. In the EAnMBR, physicochemical, biological and electrokinetic processes interacted simultaneously permitting to control the effluent quality and sludge properties. The dark-color molasses-based wastewater containing the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (53,000 mgL-1), total nitrogen (2,300 mgL-1), total phosphorus (150 mgL-1), was selected for this research and submitted to multi-phase studies. The research allowed to define optimal operational conditions leading to removal of carbon, nutrients by 99% and to complete discoloration in the EAnMBR system. The novel system was compared with anaerobic membrane bioreactor showing performance superiority of EAnMBR in respect to COD, sludge volume reduction and filterability by 10%, 54% and 7%, respectively. A separate experimental phase was dedicated to optimize the energy balance in the novel system by the surface response method. The EAnMBR demonstrated outstanding results which make it a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for various applications, e.g. in food, agriculture and defence industries.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nFollowing the June 22, 1940 armistice and the subsequent occupation of northern France by the Germans, the French government left Paris and eventually established itself in the city of Vichy. The name ‘Vichy’ soon came to be used to refer to the regime instigated by Pétain and his ministers. The shortcut was maintained and popularized in the postwar period, to the great displeasure of the Vichyssois, who have long been refusing to incorporate the war into the city’s history. Whereas the Vichy regime is considered one of the most defining historical events of France’s recent past, in the French memorial landscape of the Second World War, the city of Vichy continues to stand out as a non lieu de mémoire.\nThis dissertation investigates the wartime period in Vichy and explores how the population has dealt with the fraught legacy of the Vichy regime from 1944 to the present. My research examines how the interaction between national mythology, specific local concerns, and broader troubling issues have impacted – and often blocked – the formation of a local war memory. In the immediate postwar years, local resisters strove to establish a strong memory of the resistance. At the same time, a powerful victimhood myth emerged in response to the city’s fears of stigmatization and ostracism. The spa tourism’s recovery in the early 1950s marked a significant change in the city’s memorial politics, leading to the memory of the war being pushed into the background, thereby establishing a tradition of silence in Vichy. This, however, does not mean that the memories of the war never resurfaced. They did, especially during the Algerian War. In the 1950s, Vichy’s economy largely depended on colonial spa tourism. Known as the “Capitale d’été de l’Afrique du Nord,” Vichy was indeed a privileged summer destination for thousands of settlers, especially pieds noirs from Algeria. The fear provoked by the prospect of a grave economic crisis in the event that Algeria would become independent led to a rightward shift of the population. This shift provided the ideal environment for a pro-Pétain memory to gather strength in Vichy, beyond Pétain’s traditional extreme right base. While in the 1950s, Pétain’s myth also enjoyed a revival of popularity in France, it declined rapidly, when, following the end of the Algerian War, the extreme right hit historical lows. In Vichy, on the other hand, this counter memory continued to develop in the 1960s. In the post 1970s period, although the local Petainist memory went underground, no other memory has risen to occupy a central place in the local collective remembering of the war, turning the city into a non lieu de mémoire and making it a counter example of what has been happening in many other places across Europe, where the most shameful aspects of the Second World War have been memorialized.\nWhere\nRoom GM 930.48, Guy-De Maisonneuve Building (1550 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMost of the Researchers’ interest is focusing on Bridge Management System (BMS), by its Maintenance, Repair & Rehabilitation (MR&R) segments, while a good practice of bridge management should cover the conceptual design phase of a new bridge. Although conceptual design is one stage of a bridge life whereas there is still limited knowledge on how it should be conducted. Most often engineers’ decisions are based on their past experience and standard solutions, which are affected by the subjectivity. This approach, most probably, does not reflect the effective way to address different problems of consistency in the decision. To design a new bridge, many factors, like the cost and aesthetic behavior, have to be considered due to their ability to affect the final decision. Generally, decision-makers will make their final design and decisions based on those factors in addition to human subjectivity.\nThe objective of this research is to propose a methodology to develop systematic procedures that can help decision-makers select the most appropriate bridge type with its diverse components and to forecast its Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and other characteristics such as the public satisfaction and environment sustainability of the selected bridge type. The proposed methodology integrates a decision support system with a relevant database within an artificial intelligence environment (AI) and bridge information management tools in order to reduce the impact of human subjectivity on the decision taken during the conceptual design stage of bridges life.\nFor this purpose, Machine Learning technique, which is a part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) environment, will be the core of the proposed methodology. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with its back-propagation algorithm is adopted in order to identify the appropriate solution by setting up its engine guidelines. A polynomial regression method will first be integrated in the DSS: 1) to formulate the database in order to establish the needed functions; 2) to define the input values for the ANN; and 3) to verify the intermediate ANN weightiness of the proposed methodology engine based on historic data retrieved from the database. An investigation will be conducted in order to define bridge characteristics and parameters, to be used in the ANN, and that affect the final decision.\nElements of the ANN layers (Engine model) which include: Input, Hidden & output layers, have to be described based on a systematic and standardized process. The proposed methodology has the potential to be used in lower levels to determine other bridge components such as vertical structures, foundations and connection types. The objectives of the proposed methodology can be summarized as follow:\nAvoiding, as much as possible, the influence of human subjectivity on the decision-making process.\nListing and Ranking all the other possible alternatives.\nEnsuring equivalent and fair consideration for all factors affecting the decision, and especially reducing the possibility to miss and overlook the impact of some factors that could be ignored while proceeding with making the right decision by using conventional decision-making approaches.\nDeveloping a model that can be considered as a guideline for further use that can be applied within any decision-making environment and based on a relevant historic database and experts’ input.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nMany industrial systems are nonlinear with “slow” and “fast” dynamics because of the presence of some “parasitic” parameters. These systems are usually labeled as “singularly perturbed” or “multi-time-scale” systems. Singular perturbation theory has been proved to be a useful tool to control and analyze singularly perturbed systems if the full knowledge of the system model parameters is available. However, the accurate and faithful mathematical models of those systems are usually difficult to obtain due to the uncertainties and nonlinearities.\nTo obtain the accurate system models, in this research, a new identification scheme for the discrete time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural network and optimal bounded ellipsoid method is proposed firstly. Compared with other gradient descent based identification schemes, the new identification method proposed in this research can achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain. Later, the optimal bounded ellipsoid based identification method for discrete time systems is extended to the identification of continuous singularly perturbed systems. Subsequently, by adding two additional terms in the weight’s updating laws, a modified identification scheme is proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the identification algorithm during the whole identification process. Lastly, through introducing some filtered variables, a robust neural network training algorithm is proposed for the system identification problem subjected to measurement noises.\nBased on the identification results, the singular perturbation theory is introduced to decompose a high order multi-time-scale system into two low order subsystems – the reduced slow subsystem and the reduced fast subsystem. Then, two controllers are designed for the two subsystems separately. By using the singular perturbation theory, an adaptive controller for a regulation problem is designed in this research firstly. Because the system order is reduced, the adaptive controller proposed in this research has a simpler structure and requires much less computational resources, compared with other conventional controllers. Afterwards, an indirect adaptive controller is proposed for solving the trajectory tracking problem. The stability of both identification and control schemes are analyzed through the Lyapunov approach, and the effectiveness of the identification and control algorithms are demonstrated using simulations and experiments.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.\nOnce accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nAn effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) technology can play a crucial role in improving the system availability, safety and reliability as well as reducing the risks of catastrophic failures. In this thesis, the robust sensor FDI problem of gas turbine engines is investigated and different novel techniques are developed to address the effects of parameter uncertainties, disturbances as well as process and measurement noise on the performance of FDI strategies. The efficiencies of proposed techniques are investigated through extensive simulation studies for the single spool gas turbine engine that is previously developed and validated using the GSP software. The gas turbine engine health degradation is considered in various forms in this thesis. First, it is considered as a part of the engine dynamics that is estimated off-line and updated periodically for the on-board engine model. Second, it is modeled as the time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty that affects all the system state-space matrices and third as an unknown nonlinear dynamic that is approximated by the use of a dynamic recurrent neural network.\nIn the first part of the thesis, we propose a hybrid Kalman filter (HKF) scheme that consists of a single nonlinear on-board engine model (OBEM) augmented with piecewise linear (PWL) models constituting as the multiple model (MM) based estimators to cover the entire engine operating regime. We have integrated the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based method with our MM-based scheme to estimate the sensor fault severity under various single and concurrent fault scenarios. In order to ensure the reliability of our proposed HKF-based FDI scheme during the engine life cycle, it is assumed that the reference baselines are periodically updated for the OBEM health parameters.\nIn the second part of the thesis, a novel robust sensor FDI strategy using the MM-based approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for mul- tiple PWL models. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibil- ity conditions. The main objective is to propose a robust filter that satisfies the overall performance requirements and is not affected by system perturbations. The requirements include a quadratically stable filter that ensures bounded estimation error variances having predefined values.\nIn the third part of the thesis, a novel hybrid approach is proposed to improve the robustness of FDI scheme with respect to different sources of uncertainties. For this purpose, a dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) is designed to ap- proximate the gas turbine engine uncertainty due to the health degradations. The proposed DRNN is trained offline by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) al- gorithm for an engine with different levels of uncertainty, but with healthy sensors. The convergence of EKF-based DRNN training algorithm is also investigated. Then, the trained DRNN with the fixed parameters and topology is integrated with our online model-based FDI algorithm to approximate the uncertainty terms of the real engine. In this part, the previously proposed HKF and RKF are integrated with the trained DRNN to construct the hybrid FDI structure.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis thesis contributes and provides solutions to the problem of fault diagnosis and estimation from three different perspectives which are i) fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using nonlinear multiple model approach, ii) inversion-based fault estimation in linear systems, and iii) data-driven fault diagnosis and estimation in linear systems. The above contributions have been demonstrated to the gas turbines as one of the most important engineering systems in the power and aerospace industries.\nThe proposed multiple model approach is essentially a hierarchy of nonlinear Kalman filters utilized as detection filters. A nonlinear mathematical model for a gas turbines is developed and verified. The fault vector is defined using the Gas Path Analysis approach. The nonlinear Kalman filters that correspond to the defined single or concurrent fault modes provide the conditional probabilities associated with each fault mode using the Bayes’ law. The current fault mode is then determined based on the maximum probability criteria. The performance of both Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are investigated and compared which demonstrates that the UKF outperforms the EKF for this particular application.\nThe problem of fault estimation is increasingly receiving more attention due to its practical importance. Fault estimation is closely related to the problem of linear systems inversion. This thesis includes two contributions for the stable inversion of non-minimum phase systems. First, a novel methodology is proposed for direct estimation of unknown inputs by using only measurements of either minimum or non-minimum phase systems as well as systems with transmission zeros on the unit circle. A dynamic filter is then identified whose poles coincide with the transmission zeros of the system. A feedback is then introduced to stabilize the above filter dynamics as well as provide an unbiased estimation of the unknown input. The methodology is then applied to the problem of fault estimation and has been shown that the proposed inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of faults. Second, a solution for unbiased reconstruction of general inputs is proposed. It is based on designing an unknown input observer (UIO) that provides unbiased estimation of the minimum phase states of the system. The reconstructed minimum phase states serve then as inputs for reconstruction of the non-minimum phase states. The reconstruction error for non-minimum phase states exponentially decrease as the estimation delay is increased. Therefore, an almost perfect reconstruction can be achieved by selecting the delay to be sufficiently large. The proposed inversion scheme is then applied to the output-tracking control problem.\nAn important practical challenge is the fact that engineers rarely have a detailed and accurate mathematical model of complex engineering systems such as gas turbines. Consequently, one can find a trend towards data-driven approaches in many disciplines, including fault diagnosis. In this thesis, explicit state-space based fault detection, isolation and estimation filters are proposed that are directly identified from only the system input-output (I/O) measurements and through the system Markov parameters. The proposed procedures do not involve a reduction step and do not require identification of the system extended observability matrix or its left null space. Therefore, the performance of the proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the errors in the Markov parameters estimation process. The estimation error dynamics is then derived in terms of the Markov parameters identification errors and directly synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation errors have been effectively compensated for. The proposed data-driven scheme requires the persistently exciting condition for healthy input data which is not practical for certain real life applications and in particular to gas turbine engines. To address this issue, a robust methodology for Markov parameters estimation using frequency response data is developed. Finally, the performance of the proposed data-driven approach is comprehensively evaluated for the fault diagnosis and estimation problems in the gas turbine engines.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

Using the theory of hidden Markov models (HMM) we derive a Poisson-gamma HMM and a hybrid between HMMs and generalized linear models (HMM-GLM). The hidden state is meant to represent a driver's skill thus capturing an unseen variable. The Poisson-gamma HMM and HMM-GLM have two emissions, severity and claim count, making it easier to compare to current actuarial models. The proposed models help deal with the over dispersion problem in claim counts and introduces dependence between the severity and claim count. We derive maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the proposed models and then using simulations with the Expectation Maximization algorithm we compare the three methods: GLMs, HMMs and HMM-GLMs. We show that in some instances the HMM-GLM outperforms the standard GLM, while the Poisson-gamma HMM under-performs the other models. Thus in certain situations it may be worth the added complexity of a HMM-GLM.\nWhere\nRoom 921-4, J.W. McConnell Building (1400 De Maisonneuve W.), Sir George Williams Campus\nOrganizer\n"}

These systems can be reversibly and controllably transformed between several different stable conformations, and will respond to orthogonal stimuli.

There has been some interest in the development of morality in humans, as well as interest in cultural differences when it comes to moral practices, commitments, and actions. However, until relatively recently there has been little focus on the possibility that nonhuman animals have any role to play in morality, save being the object of moral concern. Moreover, when nonhuman cases are considered as evidence of moral agency or subjecthood, there has been a tendency to focus on higher-order moral behaviors (i.e., those same behaviors that inform our views about human moral agency). If we are to understand the evolution of moral psychology and moral practice, then this relative lack of attention to the practices of other animals and this persistent focus on the moral instead of the normative have been great oversights.\nA biologically responsible way of examining the distribution of moral practice in other animals starts from considering the distribution of normative practice across species. Drawing on the work of psychologists and anthropologists, the normative foundations of morality across humans demonstrates that some animals—chimpanzees and cetaceans in particular—demonstrate many of the moral foundations that indicate the existence of a cognitive modality I call naïve normativity.\nWhere\nRoom 201, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nThis dissertation analyzes the convoluted process by which Irish nationalists, Irish unionists, and British politicians negotiated Irish self-government in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In December 1909, a modest form of self-government known as home rule within the British Empire for all of Ireland became a practical issue in United Kingdom politics again, after the failure of two previous home rule bills in 1886 and 1893. After a decade that witnessed a world war and a revolution in Ireland, two new Irish polities emerged by June 1922. Northern Ireland, a majority-unionist state comprised of six counties in the province of Ulster, acquired a limited form of home rule within the United Kingdom. Covering the rest of the island, the Irish Free State secured significant control of its domestic affairs as a dominion of the British Empire, though not the complete independence demanded by Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had waged the revolution.\nHow did the main political parties and actors in Britain and Ireland arrive at this settlement, especially as it was so different from how elites had envisioned Irish self-government in 1909? Using archival material and public discourse, this dissertation seeks to answer this question by methodically analyzing the political decisions taken by British and Irish political parties and movements between 1909 and 1922. It challenges historical conceptions that the settlement enacted by the Government of Ireland Act (1920) and the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) was an inevitable evolution in Anglo-Irish relations, that it marks the British government’s recognition of the Irish right to self-determination, or the triumph of Irish democracy. Instead, I argue that the settlement was highly contingent upon prevailing political circumstances, heavily influenced by British interests, and often defied the democratic demands of Irish people, both nationalist and unionist. Partition, the separation of Ireland into two different states, was achieved through the acquiescence of British politicians to the demands of Ulster unionist leaders, without reference to public opinion in any part of Ireland.\nWhere\nRoom H 1001.01, Henry F.

This study aims to better understand the contribution of research-for-design education, not only as a required activity in the design process, but also as a strategy to develop a vision for sustainable design. This comparative study examined two university design programs, the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí in San Luis Potosí, Mexico. I examined student and teacher accounts of how research is taught in each program. Through a process of comparative analysis, I identified differences in the participating students and educators’ backgrounds and design streams which led to varied perspectives of disciplinary practice. Formal and informal methods of doing research-for-design were identified and linked to accounts of teaching and learning. These practices in the education of research-for-design included intuitive, informal, spontaneous, ludic, innovative, visual, creative, social, and emphatic strategies. Teaching research-for-design demands an effective way to connect students with their entire environment. By doing this, the education of research-for-design will empower students’ understanding of the design process with the potential to promote ethical, sustainable, comprehensive, and integrative design.\nWhere\nRoom EV 2.776, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

These manuscripts are linked by the overarching question “How do employees manage the bombardment of myriad reflected appraisals in their daily organizational lives?” To address this, the articles examine four workplace manifestations of reflected that are represented by the constructs of perceived supervisor support, organizational support, respect and external prestige (also called image) while considering the referents inherent in each construct (i.e., Co-workers, team members, the employing organization and external stakeholders). The theoretical manuscript (article 1) examines the four reflected appraisals together, asking what contextual and individual factors predict which reflected appraisals employees are more likely to focus on and when. We use employees’ work-roles as the key construct that links these factors together, arguing that self-motives drive individuals to focus on some reflected appraisals under the constraint of accountability and interdependence that are part of the organizational structure. The quantitative manuscript (article 2) examines the concurrent impact of respect and prestige on relational and organizational identification. In a survey of student-athletes from varsity sports teams, we found that the matching principle prevailed: Prestige and respect that are focused on the relationship predicted relational identification while respect and prestige focused on the collective predicted organizational identification. However, prestige was the better predictor of both the relational and organizational foci. The qualitative manuscript (article 3) focuses on organizational image and explores how individuals respond to perceived organizational stigma. I interviewed employees of general contractors during a city-wide scandal in which various audiences marked their organizations as “the enemy” by virtue of their category-membership. I found that interviewees negotiated two images that embodied individuating and de-individuating reflected appraisals of their organization. Furthermore, employees constructed these images using various sources of information that they integrated into their reflected appraisals. Overall, the three articles demonstrate that employees actively engage with a plethora of reflected appraisals from multiple referents in the organizational environment.\nWhere\nRoom MB 12.101, John Molson Building (1450 Guy), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

It does this by engaging current scholarship on “Comedy,” building upon some of its fundamentals, yet showing that the picture we get of “Comedy” in this literature should be supplemented. To this end, the paper explicates Hegel’s claim that the individual is a “negative power,” and then develops a central point in Hegel’s section on “Comedy,” namely, that in comedy abstract universals are put in play and revealed as they are actually made concrete in the lives of individuals. This reveals the pretensions of abstract universals, unmasking the gap between what we might think of a universal, such as honesty, and this universal in it concrete/actual form. It this pretense and gap that Hegel finds comedic.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

Gavin is completing his MA in Philosophy at Concordia.\nAbstract:\nWhat is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia manifests differently in different cultures, according to different modes of understanding. Modern scientific understandings of the disease categorize it as a neurological disorder, primarily biological or genetic in nature, with the experience of the disease manifesting in the ‘split mind(s)’ (schizo- phrēne) of patients. But there is mounting empirical evidence to suggest that biogenetic and neurologically reductive approaches are limited with respect to their treatment outcomes, and – as I argue – specifically alienating to patients. Patients are faced both with social alienation, and a sense of alienation from self – I argue that this is primarily by the disease’s interaction with its cultural and political situatedness, rather than by the manifestation of disease itself. Leaning on Marx and Foucault, I seek to readdress the question of schizophrenic ontology in this essay, motivating for a model that will attenuate the experience of alienation thought symptomatic of schizophrenia by approaching it as dialectical co-production of both biogenetic, and sociocultural factors. The result is to argue for the irreducibility of the experience of vulnerability in future research seeking to open up treatment options for patients with schizophrenia.\nWhere\nRoom 05, S Annex (2145 Mackay), Sir George Williams Campus\nSpeakers\n"}

This fact highlights the importance of improving indoor air quality (IAQ) in in areas including sustainable buildings. Among different air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a major part of indoor pollutants. The proven negative impact of these compounds in occupants’ health has motivated researchers to develop different air treatment technologies for the removal of VOCs.\nDevelopment of plasma-based methods, and their remarkable capabilities for VOCs degradation, has motivated designers to employ these methods as indoor air purification. It has been demonstrated that utilizing a dual functional adsorbent/catalyst (DFA/C) in a plasma system can significantly enhance the VOCs removal and energy efficiency of such an air purifier. However, selecting an appropriate DFA/C is a challenge to achieve the best performance in these systems.\nFor the first time, this research attempted to utilize metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as DFA/Cs for a plasma-driven catalytic reactor. Accordingly, three different MOFs, MIL-101 (MIL: Metal institute Lavoisier), MIL-53, and CPM-5 (CPM: Crystalline Porous Material-5), were synthesized through microwave, solvothermal and mechanochemical methods. To test the performance of these DFA/Cs, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was designed and implemented as a non-thermal plasma (NTP) set-up. During preparation and evaluation experiments, different characterization and analytical instruments, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatogram/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS), Ozone monitor, and VOC Photoionization detector (PID), were utilized.\nSeveral adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted to study physical and chemical behaviors of MOFs for the removal of one (1) ppm toluene and isobutanol on MIL-101, MIL-53 and CPM-5. Also, the effect of the presence of 30% relative humidity on the adsorption capacity and oxidation ability of each MOF was investigated. Results showed physisorption of VOCs on all MOFs during the course of adsorption tests. Moreover, the stable structure of the examined MOFs before and after plasma-catalytic reactions indicated a facile regeneration of catalysts. During the plasma-catalytic oxidation of toluene and isobutanol, different organic by-products and ozone were detected either in dry or humid conditions for all MOFs.\nMIL-101 and MIL-53 exhibited much higher adsorption and oxidation ability compared to CPM-5 in most of the experiments. Results demonstrated a higher adsorption capacity and almost the same oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 compared to MIL-53 in dry air. Nevertheless, the negative influence of humidity on adsorption and oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 was more significant than in MIL-53.\nIn conclusion, results demonstrated the potential capacity of MOFs as DFA/Cs in a NTP system.\nWhere\nRoom EV 1.162, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

This oral exam is open to the public.\nAbstract\nA growing number of recalcitrant pollutants of both human health and environmental concern (e.g., pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals) are being introduced to Canadian and global water and wastewater systems at an alarming rate. While conventional water and wastewater treatment technologies are effective at providing clean, usable water, these methods are inadequate for the complete removal of these emerging aquatic contaminants. Unlike naturally occurring aquatic organic compounds, these emerging contaminants must not only be removed from aqueous systems but also degraded to non-toxic constituent compounds. Membrane filtration is currently one of the most effective technologies for water purification, but conventional membranes lack mechanisms for contaminant degradation. Many environmental contaminants are highly susceptible to aggressive oxidative or reductive degradation. This is achievable with electro-filtration along with electro-enhanced oxidation and reduction processes.\nElectrochemical filtration is a promising technology that aims for the efficient removal of persistent contaminants that cannot be effectively eliminated through conventional treatment methods. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and carbon substrates can be employed as filtration media to which a DC potential can be applied for further electrochemical treatment.\nThis study consists of two main objectives: firstly, an investigation of MWNTs and carbon substrates and the use of electrochemical filtration in dead-end filtration systems, and secondly, the application of the same technologies in crossflow filtration systems for the removal and degradation of model persistent organic contaminants. Through the course of the study, MWNTs were employed as filtration media and tested under different surface conditions and solution chemistries with the aim of achieving the most effective elimination of the model persistent organic contaminants.\nIbuprofen and Bisphenol A, two emerging contaminants of concern, have been reported to exist in natural waters, influent, secondary treated effluent of wastewater, and in primary and secondary wastewater sludge. In this study, dead-end electrochemical filtration was investigated as a removal method for these contaminants. This technique has shown promise in the elimination of both of these compounds and the reduction of their overall toxicity. In these dead-end electrochemical filtration experiments, we employed multiwalled carbon nanotubes as both a filtration and electrode material. As well, the stability of MWNTs was studied under different surface and bulk structural conditions.\nCarboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs-COOH) were used with the aim of increasing the filtration efficiency for the removal of carboxylated ibuprofen under different pH and electrolytic conditions. It was found that the presence of oxy-functional groups can increase the functional surface area of MWNTs and increase the filtration capacity in low voltage applications. In high voltage applications, it was found that electrochemical filtration is controlled by bulk electroactive species. Boron doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (BMWNTs) were also studied, with the goal of improving electrical conductivity during bisphenol A electrochemical filtration experiments. It was found that despite previous reports describing the higher oxidative power of doped carbon nanotubes, with the highest reported for BMWNTs, pristine MWNTs and BMWNTs showed similar outcomes in eliminating bisphenol A. The results indicate adequate performance and efficiency of pristine MWNTs in removing bisphenol A. These results demonstrate the dead-end electrochemical filtration as a promising technology for the removal of these emerging contaminants.\nThe removal of ibuprofen and bisphenol A was also investigated by using crossflow electrochemical filtration for individual and equimolar mixture solutions. The aim was, firstly, to investigate electrochemical filtration performance under the horizontal shear flow mechanism in a flat sheet crossflow setup. Large surface area, superconductive MWNT blend buckypaper membranes were used as electrochemical filtration electrodes.\nThe crossflow configuration shows great potential in eliminating these two contaminants in both individual component and mixed solutions from pure and fouling electrolytes. This outcome can mainly be attributed to the crossflow mechanism and can be assigned to the horizontal shear flow, which likely leads to a consistent surface coverage, combined with the greater conductivity of the MWNT blend buckypaper membrane. The long residence time within the membrane likely leads to a significant reduction in toxicity under applied voltage. Our results suggest that the electrochemical filtration technology based on MWNTs has a potential for use as a polishing step for removal of emerging contaminants from natural waters and secondary wastewater effluents.\nWhere\nRoom EV 3.309, Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.), Sir George William Campus\nCost\n"}

Photo: Guy L'Heureux.\nEN\nFor over three decades, the annual undergraduate exhibition has presented works by students in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University. In recent years, the initiative has expanded to include writers from the department of Art History and designers from the department of Design and Computation Arts. Together, a uniquely designed catalogue illustrates the diversity of works and texts that reveal the breadth of talent found within the faculty of fine arts.\nWe are pleased to introduce a new layer to this year’s iteration and are working with performers from Concordia’s department of Contemporary Dance. As such, the growing collaboration has compelled us to come up with a theme to unify the participating disciplines. The thematic of “space” was introduced to encourage thought-provoking concepts that stem from notions of space, which has the potential to be interpreted broadly within various creative practices. For example, there is the space between generations, pictorial space, the space between performer and audience, geographic space, queer space, political space, outer space, to name only a few.\nThe FOFA Gallery salutes the extraordinary work of the artists, writers, designers and dancers proving that cross-disciplinary practice continues to be an engaging approach within the creative process. We also wish to acknowledge the dedicated guidance from professors in all of these departments who have inspired a dynamic illustration of current interests and artistic explorations.\nFaire des espaces\nExposition des étudiants et étudiantes de premier cycle\nDu 16 janvier au 17 février 2017\nFR\nDepuis plus de trente ans, les étudiantes et étudiants de 1er cycle de la Faculté des beaux-arts de l’Université Concordia présentent leurs œuvres dans le cadre d’une exposition annuelle. Ces dernières années, l’initiative s’est enrichie de la contribution de rédacteurs du Département d’histoire de l’art et de designers du Département de design et d’arts numériques. Ensemble, ceux-ci réalisent un catalogue original où œuvres, textes et facture graphique mettent en lumière l’ampleur des talents issus de la faculté.\nC’est avec plaisir que nous ajoutons un nouveau volet à l’édition de cette année grâce à l’apport d’artistes du Département de danse contemporaine. Pour nourrir cette collaboration florissante, nous avons jugé utile de choisir un thème qui unifierait les disciplines participantes. Ainsi, nous avons mis de l’avant le concept d’« espace » afin d’encourager la réflexion sur un sujet se prêtant à une multitude d’interprétations au sein de diverses pratiques créatives. Par exemple, l’espace entre les générations, l’espace pictural, l’espace entre l’artiste et le public, l’espace géographique, l’espace queer, l’espace politique ou l’espace extraterrestre.\nLa Galerie FOFA salue le travail extraordinaire des artistes, rédacteurs, designers et danseurs, qui prouve que le croisement des disciplines demeure une démarche stimulante dans le processus de création. Nous souhaitons enfin remercier les membres du corps professoral des divers départements, dont le soutien dévoué a inspiré cette illustration dynamique des réflexions théoriques et des explorations artistiques de l’heure.\nArtists / Artistes\nLand of Plenty (detail) (2016), Jordan Beaulieu.

Looking to better understand the challenges associated with growing diversity and the struggles faced by liberal democracies when managing the interests of diverse groups? Look no further, this is the workshop for you.\nIn a diverse society such as Canada’s, where the recognition of diversity and its protection are deeply embedded within institutions of the state, debates have long been over the best ways to recognize and guarantee group rights within a strong liberal framework.\nIn her workshop, Dr. Eisenberg, Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria, will explore the many complexities in the relationships between individuals, groups and the state. She will discuss the fine points that distinguish group pluralism from multiculturalism and group accommodation, as well as the dangers associated with the adoption of one understanding versus another in the management and provision of rights to diverse groups in Canada.\n"}

He will offer his perspective on the process consulting stance and on the dilemmas that often arise when a consultant intervenes in complex social systems. Conklin will suggest that the skilled intervener engages in four critical balancing acts:\nBalancing the need to challenge and at times push the client toward success with the need to create safety and to show compassion for the client. The intervener is confrontational and compassionate.\nBalancing the need to engage in planned and intentional activity with the need to be open to the emergent and unexpected. The intervener stays the course and changes course.\nBalancing the need to become part of the client system with the need to remain distinct and apart. The intervener participates and observes.\nBalancing the inclination to tell the client the solution to client problems with the need to create the conditions in which members of the client system can discover the answers for themselves. The intervener asserts and inquires.\nThe evening will allow participants to consider the strengths and opportunities that await those who wish to become more conscious and effective facilitators of social change.\nWhere\nRoom RF-100, Loyola Jesuit Hall and Conference Centre (7141 Sherbrooke W.),\nSpeakers\n"}

We’ll also discuss whether our current method of running elections, and of voting, are outdated, and whether major changes are (or should be) forthcoming.\nGo beyond the basics and dig deeper into economic, political, and procedural underpinnings of elections.

I began a Master’s Degree in 2014 with Dr. Grant E. Brown, where my research focused on studying Neophobia in Trinidadian Guppies.\nI was recently fast-tracked into the PhD program, where I will continue and expand upon my research. The amazing community of students, faculty, and staff at Concordia played a large role in my decision to stay for my PhD.\n In addition to pursuing graduate studies at Concordia, I am also the Science Liaison Officer for the Student Success Center, where I work with Student Learning Services to create and design improved study and tutoring programs for science students.\nThe resources available at Concordia and the wonderful support from both students and faculty have played a huge role in my academic success. I have built friendships and connections that will last a life time.\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo\nJacqueline Di Bartolomeo (Department of History):\nI am second-year MA History student. In my thesis, I explore the life and work of fin-de-siècle French literary critic, novelist, and traveller Thérèse (Th.) Bentzon, writing a history of her intellectual life across borders. Using Bentzon’s travelogues about the ‘condition of women’ in the United States and Canada as a starting point, I investigate the link between mobility, the development of feminism, and the making of a modern self in the nineteenth century. \nI came to history by way of journalism, having completed a BA in Journalism and German at Concordia. I was originally drawn to the Master’s program in History because of the groundbreaking work being done at the Center for Oral History and Digital Storytelling.\nThat said, the History Department has given me the invaluable opportunity to explore my research interests in gender and women’s history, histories of empire, travel, global feminism, and autobiography and life writings. My supervisor, Dr. Barbara Lorenzkowski, grounds me in the historical craft while also encouraging me to forge links across disciplinary boundaries.\nPrior to starting graduate studies, my time as a student journalist took me to Istanbul, where I reported on the Gezi Park protests in 2013, and to Munich, where I worked in communications and penned a travel blog in the summer of 2014. As an early-career scholar, I aim to combine the storytelling elements of journalism with the academic rigueur of a historian through her work.\nI hope to pursue my PhD in History, looking at the comparative emergence of feminist ideologies in France and Britain in the nineteenth century, as of Fall 2017.\nRelated topics\n"}

Emphatically so — if you’re biology researcher Grant Brown , that is. On the heels of last week’s discovery of three new species of nearly extinct salamander, the Faculty of Arts and Science professor tells us more about these environmental wizards of the amphibian world.\nWhat makes salamanders so special?\nGrant Brown: Salamanders are particularly interesting because of their trophic position within food webs.  They are prey to a variety of species — birds, mammals and snakes, for example — and are predators on many others, like tadpoles, aquatic invertebrates, some fish and terrestrial invertebrates.\nGiven their role as both predator and prey, they are often used as an indicator of ecosystem health. Anything that disturbs their prey or their predators will be reflected by the salamander population. \nWhy are salamanders particularly good indicators of environmental shifts?\nGB: Salamanders are often considered the “canary in the coal mine” because they are susceptible to small changes in habitat quality. A slight drop in ambient water: they die. A slight increase in acidity in breeding ponds: they die.\nAny animal that has a relatively short life span can be considered an indicator as subtle changes in the environmental quality will be more easily spotted. You can’t wait around to see how small changes affect long-living species.\nWhat's the significance of the discovery of three new species of salamander?\nGB: Describing three new species highlights the importance of preserving natural habitats. Natural and diverse habitat types maintain healthy biodiversity. Losing diversity, especially species that occupy key trophic positions such as salamanders, compromises the population health of all species within the community.\nHow often are new species found?\nGB: With modern molecular phylogenetic tools, new species are described frequently. However, the rate of species loss is more troubling. We are losing them faster than we can describe them!\nHow does your research involve salamanders?\nGB: My collaborative research uses salamanders as model predators and wood frog tadpoles as prey species. We are examining the role ecological uncertainty plays in shaping the cognitive ecology of prey and predators. This is a key “missing piece” in our understanding of ecosystem sustainability, made even more important as climate change, invasive species and habitat degradation are all thought to increase the uncertainty.\nLearn more about research in Concordia’s Department of Biology . \n \n"}

The catch? There are worms involved. \nThe study’s lead author, Louise Hénault-Ethier, carried out her research while pursuing a master’s from what is now Concordia’s  Individualized program . She experimented with different methods of vermicomposting to see whether they could sufficiently inactivate certain bacteria for safe public use of the compost. \n“Centralized composting, which is one of the fastest growing industrial composting methods, has strict governmental guidelines, requiring thermal sanitation to prevent the survival of harmful bacteria,” she says.\nThe guidelines require that the compost reaches and maintains a heat of 55 degrees Celsius over a period of three days in a self-heating process driven by decomposer microorganisms found in the compost. \n“But in our case, worms graze on the decomposer community, preventing the onset of high temperatures. We wanted to see if vermicomposting, which proceeds at room temperature could still get rid of harmful bacteria.”\nHénault-Ethier worked with Concordia chemistry professor Yves Gélinas and biology professor  Vincent Martin to examine the impact of vermicomposting on E. coli, a bacteria often found in fecal matter that can easily make its way into organic waste set to be composted. \nThey devised three experiments to monitor the presence of E. coli, testing whether the size of the batch of compost, the amount of naturally occurring compost microbes and the rate at which the compost was fed would affect the survival of the pathogen. \nTime and again, the worms worked their magic and eventually produced compost that respected the regulatory bacterial count limits. When the normal compost microbes or worms were present, E. coli declined more rapidly. Without worms or with sterile compost, it took a little more time to get there.  \n\"We found that the compost batches take on average 18 to 21 days to decrease the E. coli to levels well below the legal limit,” explains Gélinas, who worked closely with Hénault-Ethier to examine how the chemicals, such as Carbon, Nitrogen or sugars, present in the compost materials would affect the bacteria’s survival.\n“While that's slower than traditional composting methods, it’s not a prohibitive amount of time.\"\n‘Upcycling waste’\nFor Hénault-Ethier, who was recently named head of scientific projects for the David Suzuki Foundation , it’s the added benefits of vermicomposting that are most important, beyond the results of the E. coli survival experiments.\n\"The compost it produces may lead to higher plant yields when used as a fertilizer, and — even more surprising — the red wigglers themselves could then be reused as feed for other animals on the food chain,” she says.\nThis is what's called “upcycling” — generating something more valuable than the initial waste product.\nAlthough the idea of using invertebrates as animal feed may seem a little strange, it’s actually a proven method for potentially replacing the resource-intensive soybeans or fish meal traditionally used. \n\"This study suggests that upcycling technologies like vermicomposting can be more widely developed for commercial use,” says Hénault-Ethier. As a past environmental coordinator for Concordia, she spearheaded a large-scale worm-farming project in which 15 tons of the university’s waste were composted per year.\n“Though traditional compost can rapidly kill potential pathogens through heat, industrial composting may actually take longer to reach maturity than vermicomposting. Why not wait a little longer to see pathogen declines in vermicomposting and then create a product that provides nutrient-rich feed to both plants and animals? It's a win-win situation.\"\nThe results show that vermicomposting is a promising method in the sanitation of organic waste, which would allow for producing proteins for animal feed.\nThat said, while the E. coli inactivation observed in the current study is promising, Hénault-Ethier cautions that further research on a more diverse array of pathogens is still required.\n"}

Is this behaviour selfless or self-serving?\nSacha Engelhardt has spent years studying milk sharing, known as allonursing, while completing his PhD thesis in Robert Weladji's  lab at Concordia University.\nWeladji, an associate professor of biology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences , published his first scientific paper on reindeer in 2002. The northern ungulates have been central to his research ever since. His lab studies population ecology, behavioural ecology, biodiversity conservation and welfare of captive wildlife.\nEngelhardt’s work focuses on the advantages that reindeer calves have in a group. Many animal groups share the burden of childcare — the benefits of babysitting are obvious. But the risks of milk sharing can be greater than the rewards.\n“It’s a highly costly behaviour,” says Engelhardt. “It can reduce the amount of nutrients that a mother can provide to her offspring. Lactation is the most physiologically demanding part of mammalian reproduction.”\nNot only that, but he says that this kind of teat-sharing teamwork could lead to the spread of disease.\n \nSacha Engelhardt describes some of the challenges of his fieldwork. | Photo by Megan Perra\nTargeted cooperation?\nSo, why would a mother assume the risks just to help someone else’s calf? Engelhardt has exhausted several hypotheses in search of an answer, and he’s still coming up with more to explore.\n“We have evidence for kin selection, we have some evidence for improved nutrition, we have some evidence for reciprocation,” says Engelhardt. His paper , published earlier this year in the Journal of Mammalogy, suggests that reindeer mothers nurse the calves of their relatives more than others, but these results can vary depending on a study’s design.\nMothers and daughters that normally stick together for other seasons stay far apart during calving, weakening the idea that this is an activity reserved only for the extended family.\nEngelhardt recently published another paper in the Journal of Mammalian Biology on how allonursing calves receive better nutrition and gain weight more quickly.\nAs his previous research suggests, it may be that the reindeer mothers are not so much sharing their milk as they are trading it. So, a mother would nurse another calf because her own calf has nursed from someone else.\n“We’re not sure whether or not it is targeted cooperation,” says Engelhardt. “I can’t talk about their cognitive abilities so far.”\nWhat his most recent research does find, however, is that the reindeer don’t look to return the favour immediately after their calf has suckled from someone else. The chances of reciprocity actually increase over time, and many of these reciprocations happen between pairs of reindeer mothers.\nIt’s still unclear if this trading of milk between offspring is a conscious reciprocation of milk, but Engelhardt says he’s interested in further exploring this cooperative behaviour to perhaps determine whether or not it’s intentional.\nFind out more about Concordia's Department of Biology.\n \n"}

Great if you want to make bread or wine. Not so hot if it turns up as Candida albicans in large quantities in your body and makes you sick.\nA study recently published by a team of researchers led by Concordia professor Malcolm Whiteway in Current Biology shows that the type of yeast in bread is less similar to the type that causes fungal infections than previously thought.\nThe researchers hope that by shining new light on what makes the pathogen tick, his research may eventually help create targeted drugs .\nWhen yeast goes bad\nCandida albicans is the strain of yeast that causes relatively benign infections in people with strong immune systems. But it can be a serious threat to people with compromised immune systems, such as patients with AIDS or those undergoing chemotherapy or transplants of organs or bone marrow.\n“Blood-stream infections related to Candida are frequently fatal,” says Whiteway, who conducted the study with key collaborators Walters Tebung, a PhD candidate at Concordia, and Joachim Morschhauser with Germany’s Institut für Molekulare Infektionsbiologie.\n“Because the cells of this fungus function very similarly to human cells, the antibiotics that have been so successful in treating bacterial infections are not active against them,” Whiteway adds. “And the current anti-fungal drugs can have serious side effects. My research is aimed at helping to develop a new generation of anti-fungal drugs that have limited side effects.”\nYin yang yeast\nWhiteway and his colleagues examined how a cellular process in Candida albicans differs from the one in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast used in making bread and wine. Through “genetic rewiring,” the protein controlling a particular process in one yeast species controls a different process in the other.\nThe rewiring occurs in a protein named Ppr1. In Candida albicans, this protein controls the degrading of purines — molecules that make up DNA. But the Ppr1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae controls the building of pyrimidines — molecules that make up the elements of DNA complementary to purines.\n“Imagine two similar looking houses in Montreal and Toronto. In Montreal, when you flick a switch in the living room the lights come on. But when you flick the equivalent switch in the house in Toronto the stereo goes off. The same switch is doing different jobs,” says Whiteway, who also holds a Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics in the Faculty of Arts and Science.\n“We think the reason for this is because the yeast that makes bread and wine changed its metabolism to allow it to grow without much oxygen. This led to the pressure that generated the rewiring,” he says.\nNew treatment options\nPinpointing differences between bread-making and disease-causing yeasts gives us a picture of how cells can be remarkably different even when they look similar. That’s important from a drug production standpoint. Right now, it's common practice to use Saccharomyces to develop drugs to fight Candida.\n“This study proves that we have to study the pathogen itself. We can’t just study proxies and think drugs that will treat one will work in the other,” says Whiteway.\n“If you want drugs to fight Candida you’re better off working with Candida, even though Saccharomyces is easier to come by. The more we understand about how a fungal cell works, the better we can identify weak points in its armour.”\n“We hope it will one day lead to new treatment options for patients suffering from yeast infections, with the goal of faster healing and reduced suffering.”\n"}

But for Concordia’s  Faculty of Arts and Science,  crossing traditional academic lines is exactly the goal.\nBeyond Disciplines, a new series of public events, brings together a variety of researchers to discuss a challenging issue.\n“I wanted to showcase the interdisciplinary nature of our Faculty, which I think is one of our greatest strengths,” says Dean  André Roy .\n“Very few universities in Canada have a faculty like ours, which crosses so many disciplines, from the natural sciences to the social sciences to the humanities,” he says. “That is what makes us so lucky, and that’s what the Beyond Disciplines events are going to highlight.”\nKim Sawchuk , associate dean of Research and Graduate Studies, agrees. “We need dialogues on timely topics in our society to tackle the problems and challenges that need to be addressed through different perspectives, methods and approaches,” she says.\n“We have an incredible talent pool of engaged, committed and curious researchers to draw upon, who want to meet each other and engage in these conversations for the common good.”\nPlaying with DNA\nThe first event, Editing Genes? The Science and Ethics of the New Biotechnology, will take place on Wednesday, February 10.\nConcordia experts will discuss a new tool called  CRISPR , or \"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,\" that’s made it easier than ever to edit DNA.\nNeedless to say, CRISPR technology is not without controversy, much of which focuses on its potential for abuse.\n“This technology could move quickly from the lab to the community, and people should think about it before it does,” says  Paul Joyce , associate dean of Academic Programs, and a professor in the  Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry  who has been working with Sawchuk to organize the event.\n“Legislation may have to follow,” he adds.\nDavid Secko , an associate professor from the  Department of Journalism , will host the talk.\n“I hope we can help drive discussion on how ethics and science can interface over how CRISPR is used,” he says “I’m very excited to see what our diverse faculty can bring to this event.”\nFrancesca Scala , an associate professor from the Department of Political Science , says she’s interested in the benefits and challenges of engaging citizens around such topics.\n“One of my research areas is science and technology policy and the politics of expertise that often shape who does or does not have a say in the governance of science,” she says. “At the panel, I’ll be talking about why and how citizens can participate in the debate on CRISPR.”\nOne important topic that’s bound to come up during the conversation is the  recent scandal  in the scientific community surrounding whether a team of female scientists is being denied credit for their role in creating CRISPR.\n“I think gender bias is an ongoing problem in science and technology,” says  Alisa Piekny , associate professor in the  Department of Biology , who will be participating in the event. “The older generation is especially male dominant and some, or many, may not have open biases per se, but simply favour their colleagues and friends, many of whom happen to be male — and white.”\nBut Piekny is hopeful change will come to the field. “As more men and women are less tolerant and call out their colleagues, especially for blatant bias, then this could change with time.”\nStorytelling, diversity and online learning\nBeyond Disciplines is set to grow over the months to come. A March event is planned on how storytelling and narrative can be integral to research in a variety of disciplines.\n“Storytelling is important in so many ways — I don’t see it in opposition to factual knowledge,” says Sawchuk.\n“I would argue that numbers and data tell a kind of story, as they need interpretation. How, in the faculty, can we understand what constitutes a fact, or evidence, from different disciplinary perspectives?”\nOther events in the works include a spring research showcase on the theme of diversity, and a fall discussion on Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs.\nHealthy arguments\n“We are embracing experimentation and imperfection with Beyond Disciplines,” says Roy, adding that the series will allow the faculty to embody the spirit of Concordia’s strategic directions.\n“These events are absolutely in line with the Faculty’s and university’s goals,” says Roy. “They will allow our faculty to  experiment boldly , to  mix it up , and of course to  get our hands dirty ! But, most of all, they will allow us to  go beyond .”\nWhile Sawchuk acknowledges the Faculty’s experts may not always be in agreement on the topics at hand, she says that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n“Argumentation and disagreement can be healthy if we do it well in our Faculty, and learn how to discuss and debate beyond our disciplines,” she says. “What a beautiful challenge for us as a Faculty!”\n \nThe first Beyond Disciplines event takes place on Wednesday, February 10, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics in Room GE-110, on Concordia’s Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.).\nThe event is free and open to the public.

While the symptoms are relatively mild, medical researchers have recently linked it to the birth defect microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and to suffer from brain damage.\nIn Brazil in 2014, there were only 147 cases of microcephaly. Last year, as the virus spread, that number jumped to 2,782 cases. Health officials there are advising women not to get pregnant.\nJean-Philippe Lessard is an assistant professor in Concordia’s Department of Biology . He runs the Community Ecology and Biogeography Lab . We asked him to provide some information about why the decades-old virus has suddenly become the scourge of the New World.\nZika’s trans-Atlantic voyage\nThe Zika virus was not recorded in South or North America until recently, and its arrival was probably due to transfer by humans. \nWithin the mosquito genus Aedes you have several species, some of which are unique to Africa, some of which are unique to South America and some of which are found everywhere. It seems like this virus is able to switch from one species to the other as long as they’re within that genus.\nThe species of mosquito that carry the virus are found in tropical environments all over the world — the main one being Aedes aegypti, which is found in Africa, but also India, South-east Asia, South and Central America, and also a little bit in the south-eastern United States. That seems to be the main vector. \nEradication efforts are underway in urban areas to reduce the chance of exposure to humans, and it's worked out in the past. You won't eradicate these mosquitoes, because they're everywhere, but if you reduce their density, you reduce the chance of them transmitting the disease.\nThe evolutionary arms race\nThe main problem is that when you bring a new virus into a new place, humans' immune systems are not adapted to it, and the virus takes advantage of this. You get big outbreaks because of that. Eventually, the human body will adapt to it and learn to fight it off.\nIn Africa, there's likely a higher rate or proportion of people who are immune. That's what evolutionary theory would say, at least. They're engaged in what we call an arms race, where the virus tries to become stronger and the human body tries to respond to it.\nThey've been engaged in that race for about 50 years in Africa, and so there’s some kind of equilibrium that has been reached there. In South America, it's a new phenomenon, so it might take a while before we see that happen. \n﻿Will it spread to North America?\nPeople are ﻿worried because incidences of the disease are being reported further north, closer to the United States. But if you look at other similar, neotropical viruses like Dengue or Yellow Fever, even though they're carried by the same type of mosquito, the occurrence of these diseases is relatively rare in the United States. This suggests that some kind of climactic barrier exists that prevents the virus from doing well in temperate climates.\nIt's not enough just to have the mosquito; you also need to have the right climate for the virus to do well. \nThe other thing is that, right now the virus is contained within one species of mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and that species is not widespread in the US. If it switches to other species of mosquito, then it could become more problematic.\nThis evolutionary switch has not happened yet, and even if it does happen, as it happened with yellow fever and dengue already, it still doesn't mean that the virus will be able to tolerate winter and the drier conditions that we have.\nI think a lot of things need to happen before it becomes a tangible threat in North America. Some scientists have built models trying to predict zones that would be suitable for the Zika Virus. They show that Florida could be a high-risk area.\nBut if you look at other neotropical viruses transmitted by the same mosquitoes, you would also predict finding them in the Eastern United States and especially Florida, which is kind of tropical. But you still don't find them.\nObviously, this particular virus could follow a different evolutionary path and evolve very, very quickly to adapt to both a new mosquito and new climactic conditions. But again, it's unlikely based on what we know.\nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Biology .\n \n"}

Bats also help with crops: they act as a natural pesticide by feeding on harmful insects.\nBut these winged mammals are now under threat. As agricultural intensification expands across the world, the conversion of their natural habitats has caused a dramatic decline in population. North American bats are also plagued with white-nose syndrome, an emerging infectious disease that’s decimating their numbers.\n“Many bat populations in Quebec have lost 80 to 100 per cent in recent years,” says Concordia biology professor Jean-Philippe Lessard. \nWith this in mind, researchers from Concordia and the University of Tennessee studied the importance of different types of habitats for insectivorous bats living in and around agricultural regions.\nIn a paper recently published in the journal Biological Conservation, a team including Lessard and led by graduate student Noa Davidai showed that protecting natural habitats in systems that are highly modified by humans could help struggling bat populations.\n“Our key result indicates that within an intensive agricultural landscape, the proportion of natural habitat is very important for the bats,” says Davidai, who conducted the study while pursuing graduate research at the University of Tennessee. “More natural habitat means increased bat activity, and possibly healthier populations.”\nThe researchers analyzed 9,552 hours of recordings of bat calls captured over 243 nights, from 15 separate monitoring sites in an intensively farmed region of south-central Texas. They used bat detectors and insect pheromone traps to monitor nightly bat activity, as well as the abundance of the corn earworm moth — a tasty treat for bats and also one of the world’s most destructive crop pests.\nWhile heavily farmed areas do provide bats with an enormous supply of moths to prey on, the supply varies greatly throughout the growing season. When crops are not flowering and ripening, they no longer provide a sufficient insect source: natural habitats become crucial for maintaining the bat populations.\nThese findings have economic as well as ecological implications. It’s estimated that the pest-control provided by the bats is worth well over $741,000 per year in Texas alone. And by reducing the use of pesticides in the environment, this ultimately delays the need for new pesticides.\nLessard, one of the study’s co-authors, notes that these results resonate for bat populations across North America. The 80 to 100 per cent declines seen in Quebec are, he says, due in large part to white-nose syndrome, but “the destruction of their habitats is another major problem.”\nHe adds that this is something we can all help prevent. “One thing we can do is to make sure to preserve the habitats bats need to survive. This means preserving natural patches of habitat in areas where much of the natural forest has been cut for agricultural purposes, such as in the region of Montérégie, near Montreal.”\nLessard also encourages residents to help protect bats by participating in batwatch.ca , an online initiative developed by the Government of Quebec, the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science and researchers at several universities.\n“We’re asking the citizens across Quebec and Ontario to help us locate bat colonies they might encounter in nature or around their homes,” says Lessard. “This information is crucial, as it allows us to evaluate the status of bat populations and develop a plan of action for conservation.”\n \nFind out more about biology research at Concordia . \n \n"}

Concordia biology professor Alisa Piekny shares her thoughts on a scientific scandal\nPosted on January 29, 2016\n|\nBy: Alisa Piekny\nRecently the science world has been buzzing about a controversy involving the new  genome-editing technology CRISPR . The fuss began when Eric Lander , a biology professor at MIT , penned an article for prominent science publication Cell on the history of CRISPR's discovery.\nThe article, \" The Heroes of CRISPR ,\" neglected to mention Lander is involved in a CRISPR-related patent lawsuit with two other scientists, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, who played a major role in CRISPR's development. Not only did fellow scientists question Lander's (and Cell's) lack of disclosure, but Lander was also accused of trying to write women out of CRISPR's history.\nAlisa Piekny , an associate professor in Concordia's  Department of Biology , is participating in the February 10 conference  Beyond Disciplines: Editing genes? The Science and Ethics of the New Biotechnology . We asked her to explain the outrage surrounding this scientific breakthrough.\n \nThe strange case of the missing 'heroines of CRISPR'\nWhat was your reaction when you heard about this controversy?\nAlisa Piekny: I wasn't surprised, due to the competitive nature of research — recognition, funding, publishing. Especially in a time when advances in technology and rapid communication mean that many scientists (with the means) can quickly identify and advance 'novel' areas of research. Who made a 'discovery or important advancements' becomes murky.\nSome scientists may fight to be properly recognized for their contributions, since this recognition can open the door to more patent and funding opportunities, which is crucial at a time when funding is tight in most countries. Unfortunately, those that fight the hardest also often care more about prizes and money than they do about advancing science.\nBut the recognition for important contributions to, and the advancement of, CRISPR goes even deeper than this, because it also highlights the fact that many women are often overlooked for their contributions to science. This is a problem that has occurred for decades, if not hundreds of years. \nTo be clear, the article does discuss the women involved in the history of CRISPR, but it may have glossed over the importance of their contribution and according to statements made by one of the woman involved (Doudna), may not have been entirely factually correct.\nWhat do you think this says about the prevalence of sexism in STEM disciplines?\nAP: I think gender bias is an ongoing problem in science and technology — the older generation is especially male-dominant and some, or many, may not have open bias per se, but simply favour their 'colleagues and friends', many of whom happen to be male (and white).\nI think the problem boils down to competition. People can be fiercely competitive at a time when access to funding is limited and those that are most vocal or visible often win out over those that aren't. Also, it may not be instinctive for most women to do this. \nIs this something you’ve observed in your own career, or experienced yourself? \nAP: I see this all the time in my field. The men are more successful at getting external funding, they seem to have an easier time getting papers accepted, especially in high tier journals, and they seem to be better networked in terms of collaborations and working with the private sector.\nOf course, this is circular. Some would argue that they have the better grants and opportunities because they have the better publications. But the bottom line is that many women are often disadvantaged. Further, they are often still the primary caregivers and as soon as they have a family, this restricts the time that they can dedicate to their research.\nThe agencies are getting better at recognizing this, but the fierce competition for funding is closing the door for many women in science, because it is harder for them to compete with their male peers. Publishing is also something that has become a real issue in my field, but this isn't necessarily restricted to gender — this may apply to any junior researcher.\nWhat used to be acceptable for publication as an article in a strong mid-to-high tier journal would only be considered as a 'communication or report' nowadays. And the review process doesn't always work and may not be fair. Most journals still use a blind approach, where the authors do not know the reviewers, but the reviewers know the authors. This allows the reviewers to hide behind their anonymity and they have no accountability.\nI have seen many reviews, personally, that are simply not professional or that demand unrealistic changes before a manuscript can be accepted. Some of us may not have the resources, but more importantly, would these changes actually impact the outcome of the 'story' or are they simply demanded because they are 'sexier?'\nAgain, I go back to the 'old boys club,' where publishing has become a game of who knows who, and where friends review each other’s papers.\nI am not saying that excellent science isn't published in good journals, but there likely are lots of excellent research articles that are not getting published or are not getting into better journals simply because of one reviewer that blocked it.\nMy previous supervisor used to say that 'good science will be recognized regardless of where it is published,' but I disagree. We are bombarded with more and more online journals, some of which may have questionable review practices (or no peer review), and most of us don't have the time to even consider these articles.\nWhat have you been observing about the reaction to this story, from both male and female scientists?\nAP: There are many male colleagues who are very aware that gender bias exists, which is why they brought attention to this article in the first place. Many of these men may have worked under or with women during their careers, or have wives who are active scientists. \nMichael Eisen at Berkeley  wrote an interesting piece  on the article by Lander in Cell on the discovery of CRISPR. It is very witty, and pokes fun at Lander. At the same time, though, it brings up some interesting issues regarding patenting and intellectual property, and Nobel prizes or other awards recognizing a few scientists for what was likely a coordinated effort by many scientists.\nHe highlights how the tone Lander uses to describe the history of CRISPR leading up to work done by Zhang (the scientist currently in a patent dispute from his own Institute), changes as soon as he starts discussing the work done by Zhang. (He figured out how to use the technology to efficiently edit mammalian genomes). It is clear that Lander is pushing Zhang as the key person who pushed CRISPR into the limelight. \nWhat do you think needs to change in order for things to improve?\nThere are many male colleagues who are very aware that the bias exists, which is why they brought attention to this article in the first place. Eisen is an example.\nAs more men and women are less tolerant and call out their colleagues and peers for especially blatant bias, then this should change with time. Those at the top have more onus than those at the bottom. For example, editors and panel review members for granting agencies need to become more aware and perhaps disregard reviews coming from those with potential conflicts of interest.\nI think what bothers me the most is that Cell, which is a top journal in my field, published an opinion piece by someone who has an obvious conflict of interest on the topic (Lander is the director of the Broad Institute, which is in a patent dispute on CRISPR). For me, this brings into question the ethics of the journal itself and makes you wonder how many articles were rejected or not considered on subjective bias because reviews were carried out by those with conflicts of interest.\nYou will be participating in a panel discussion on CRISPR and the new biotechnology on February 10. Do you think this issue will be raised? \nAP: I am not sure how aware the general public is about this latest scandal, but gender bias would be a great topic to discuss with the panel. It gets to the deeper issue of gender bias in STEM in general , and how women struggle for recognition in male-dominant fields. It will be interesting to see how the patent disputes play out, and the role of policy, another interesting topic that will be discussed by the panel. \n \n"}

Le jour suivant, des émeutes ont éclaté et un mouvement social est alors né : Montréal-Nord Républik. Le meurtre de Fredy Villanueva a non seulement attisé le sentiment d’exclusion sociale et le mécontentement qui sommeillaient depuis des années, mais aussi mis en lumière les tactiques de surveillance policière actuelles, l’asymétrie des pouvoirs institutionnels et le profilage racial.

Caméras de sécurité et de surveillance, télévision en circuit fermé, applications Google Maps et Google Street View usent tous d’un regard descendant jeté par divers mécanismes institutionnels asymétriques, qui façonnent des perspectives verticales composites.

Although we often think of political discourse as rational, literary sources are crucial to democratic politics as they can offer a civic education or way for citizens to think about and understand politics and political debates. Such literary sources are also essential to democratic discourse because they provide a way to engage in politics through critique and protest.\nTargeting experts from political science, English, comparative literature, classics, history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and the liberal arts, this workshop will identify crosscutting research areas which explore the important contribution of alternative epistemological approaches to understanding, promoting, and critiquing democratic practices. Within this theme, the one-day event will investigate the state of research on literary approaches to democratic political thought and identify key areas for future research. The long-term goal will result in an edited volume on the topic.\nFaculty and PhD Students should submit short abstracts of approximately 250 words.\nDeadline for proposal submissions: OCTOBER 10, 2016\nFor more information or to submit abstracts please contact:\n"}

Their work is multi-media and often involves easily found and/or scavenged materials. They are interested in getting lost while realizing the rarity of such a thing. So they make work to get lost in. Poorter and Akrey have been collecting stories and images from people who have a dead dad. They use these snippets of other people’s memories, as fuel to create a morphing landscape installation. Yes, the exhibition is about dads—dead dads at that—but it is also a rumination on memory and the size and viscosity of memory.

Leur œuvre multimédia fait souvent appel à des matériaux facilement trouvés ou récupérés. Bien qu’elles souhaitent pouvoir se perdre, elles réalisent la rareté d’une telle possibilité et cherchent donc plutôt à se perdre dans leurs créations. Le duo recueille des récits et des images de personnes dont le père est mort. Elles se servent de ces fragments de souvenirs d’autrui pour concevoir une installation paysagère évolutive. L’exposition traite ainsi des pères – des pères disparus, qui plus est –, mais il s’agit également d’une rumination sur la mémoire, sur sa portée et sa viscosité.

But like anyone with an inquisitive mind, you still grapple with life’s existential questions: Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? How close to reality is Jurassic Park?\nGood news! You don’t need be an expert to explore the realms of science and space. Concordia offers a myriad of courses that address some of these fundamental queries while exploring a range of subjects, from the vast expanses of the universe to the tiniest life-giving particles.\n \nGeneral Biology\n“Do you want to know why you need to eat food and breathe oxygen? The difference between science and pseudoscience? Or what your ancient ancestors looked like? Then General Biology is for you,” says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , who teaches BIOL 202: General Biology.\nThe course covers the fundamentals of biology and the chemistry of life. Learn about the structure and functions of cells and tissues, as well as aspects of anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, heredity and evolution.\n“It’s designed for non-scientists who are still curious about life. Through it you will learn the makings of life using everyday examples,” says Gray-Mitsumune.\n \nFundamental Nutrition\nWhere does cooking and science collide? In BIOL 203: Fundamental Nutrition, of course, where you’ll take a hands-on approach to food composition.\n“Cooking teaches us food chemistry. Thankfully, every home still comes equipped with a kitchen,” says instructor Catherine Calogeropoulos , who teaches her students the science of nutrition through an array of culinary experiments.\nCan you use milk in a sauce recipe that calls for cream? Probably not, says Calogeropoulos. Relative to milk, cream contains a lot less protein. Under high heat, milk can cause the sauce to curdle — and make you look like a foolish foodie.\n“Science reveals itself magically before our eyes in the kitchen. By perusing the molecular gastronomy literature I’ve found perfect cooking examples to anchor nearly all the scientific concepts that might elude my students and senior auditors,” she says.\n \nFundamentals of Health and Physical Activity\nThis course touches upon a range of topics: cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, weight management, nutrition, disease prevention and even stress management.\n“Students will gain both knowledge and tools to maximize their health and energy, immediately and in the long term,” says instructor Leslie Barker, who teaches EXCI 251: Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity.\n“Many students comment that EXCI 251 helped them improve their own negative eating, smoking, stress and inactivity habits, while they also learned to differentiate between scientific facts and marketing hype,” adds Barker.\n \nForensic Analysis\nEveryone knows that DNA analysis revolutionized forensics, but how? If you want to find out,  Cameron Skinner , associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, suggests you take CHEM 298 AA.\n“Our approach is to first learn the underlying principles by starting with the basics such as molecules, chemical reactions and so on, before working our way towards the sophisticated tools used in a modern forensics lab,” says Skinner.\n“You will finish the course with a more realistic understanding of the field of forensics. You'll also understand the capacities and limitations of modern analysis. Some of the lessons will be case studies, some will be drawn from the textbook ... and there will be an occasional poisoning and/or murder.”\nPlease note: Skinner says he will not take responsibility for any damages or strife caused when you begin yelling at your TV during crime shows such as CSI.\n \nDiscovering Biotechnology\n“Did you enjoy The Martian?  Were you thrilled by Jurassic Park?  Did Gattaca give you pause for thought? If so, we may have a course for you,” says Paul Joyce , a professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Concordia.\nCHEM 209: Discovering Biotechnology begins with an exploration of the roles that genes and proteins play in life processes.\nIt then examines the basic principles behind the manipulation of biological molecules to produce desired changes. The course also explores the ethical ramifications of such actions.\n“Would you like to know how close we are to establishing a base on Mars? Or if we can really clone dinosaurs (or people, for that matter)? Or how close we are to the spectre of genetic discrimination?” asks Joyce. “Then register for this course.”\n \nIntroduction to Astronomy\nBlack holes, constellations, the Milky Way galaxy and beyond — PHYS 284: Introduction to Astronomy is the course for anyone interested in space.\n“Students will be introduced to advanced topics from cosmology, including the Big Bang theory, as well as the study of extra-solar planets and the search for extraterrestrial life,” says Mario D’Amico from Concordia’s Department of Physics.\nPHYS 284 will be offered as an online course this winter session. Browse through multimedia components and narrated lectures on major topics in astronomy, from the comfort of your own couch.\n“Students will have the flexibility of taking the course using their computers. They will therefore not be required to travel, or even be located in Montreal,” adds D'Amico.\n \nRegister online through the MyConcordia portal for these classes. Space is limited.\n \n"}

Now a team of Concordia biologists is putting this ancient organism under the microscope to understand how to slow human aging and delay the onset of diseases of aging, including cancer.\nLed by Vladimir Titorenko, professor in the Department of Biology and Concordia University Research Chair in Genomics, Cell Biology and Aging, the team studies the aging of yeast cells in a state-of-the-art laboratory in Concordia’s Richard J. Renaud Science Pavilion on the Loyola Campus. The work is part of an ongoing project in tandem with research partners in Montreal and Saskatoon.\nAnd their effort has led to some promising discoveries.\n“Quite simply, we study aging of baker’s yeast to understand how to slow aging and extend the healthy lifespan of humans,” says Vladimir Titorenko (centre), professor in the department of biology, of the experiments being carried out in his lab in Concordia’s Richard J. Renaud Science Pavilion.  He is pictured with researchers Pamela Dakik and Younes Medkour.\nYeast, Titorenko explains, is an ideal material on which to conduct experiments in aging for several reasons. “It’s been known for a very long time that many features of yeast cells have biological processes that are very close to the same kinds of processes that occur in human cells, and that includes aging and diseases of old age,” he says.\nThe yeast most commonly used in these experiments is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the kind used in making bread, beer and wine. “Most of the genes which are now known to regulate aging in animals and other organisms have been discovered in yeast first,” Titorenko says, adding that the same sets of genes responsible for aging in yeast are also responsible for aging in mice. Also, studies of aging in yeast have led to the discovery of most of the chemical molecules that can delay aging in animals.\nAnother advantage to working with yeast cells is that they age much more rapidly than the cells of many other organisms, which is a great time saver for the researchers. Titorenko points out that the aging process for mice can take up to three years, which makes for a long experiment period, while a comparable study using yeast cells can be carried out in as little as two weeks.\nTitorenko and other scientists believe that questions about how our bodies age are crucial to cancer research because the two are so closely associated. “Cancer is considered to be an age-related disorder, along with neurodegenerative ones such as Parkinson’s disease,” he explains. “That’s why we are interested in how some chemical molecules of natural origin can delay aging.”\nBile acid kills cancer cells\nThe research process may be slow, but the passion and relentless curiosity shared by Titorenko’s graduate student researchers and their supervisor drives them — and all it takes is one “eureka!” moment to push the whole process forward and charge the young scientists with renewed enthusiasm. One of those moments occurred during a robotic screening process of thousands of natural chemical molecules to find several groups of molecules that delay yeast aging. Among them was a group of relatively common bile acid molecules found in the human body.\nTitorenko and his colleagues published a paper outlining their discovery that bile acids produced by the liver are especially effective in delaying the aging process in yeast and therefore show promise as a possible weapon against cancer cells — a theory that has been further developed by his research partners.\n“We were trying to identify molecules that can delay aging in yeast, so we conducted a screening,” Titorenko says of how it all came about. “We tested with the help of a robot many thousands of different chemical compounds from commercially available collections to see which of them would delay aging in yeast, and we found more than 20 of them.”\nTitorenko points out that a bile acid called lithocholic acid was one chemical group found to be most effective in delaying aging. Lithocholic acid is considered to be a secondary bile acid, he explains, because it is produced by bacteria in the colon rather than the liver.\nA long road to Concordia\nTitorenko’s lifelong interest in biological and chemical sciences led him on a career path that brought him to Concordia in 2002. Originally from the former Soviet Union, his academic credentials began accumulating with bachelor and graduate degrees in biochemistry from Lvov (now Lviv) University in Ukraine. From there he earned a PhD in genetics from the Institute of Genetics and Selection of Industrial Microorganisms in Moscow, which was followed by a three-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.\nHe later came to Canada to undertake a second postdoc fellowship, this one at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, which preceded his move to Montreal and his current position at Concordia.\n“My primary interest for a very long time was completely far away from aging or cancer,” Titorenko says. “It was how a certain type of organelle known as peroxisome is formed, specifically in yeast cells. But at a certain point I switched my interest to aging, specifically the molecular mechanism of cell aging in yeast, and I’ve been doing that for about the past eight years.”\nAlong the way, Titorenko has maintained a high profile in the academic community as a lecturer and a prolific author and editor, having written or contributed to more than 100 scientific papers and five books. His work has brought him into contact with some of the scientists and academics with whom he still collaborates today. As a result, his team of researchers at Concordia are not working alone — their lab is part of a network of related aging and cancer research projects underway across Canada.\nA dedicated team\nTitorenko’s research on yeast cells is being carried out with the help of a team of graduate students he has recruited to see to the day-to-day operation of the lab. Each is assigned a specific function to perform in the process.\nPamela Dakik, BSc (biol.) 15, is exactly where she wants to be right now. Dakik has always had a passion for science, especially biology, and has followed that academic path since high school. Dakik now finds herself not only working on a major research project just a year after completing her undergraduate degree, but also fast-tracked to begin her PhD in September.\n“I took a class with Titorenko and then started volunteering in his lab,” Dakik says of how she first became involved in the project. “I saw the work being done, and after two semesters I took a course where I had a chance to conduct hypothesis-driven experiments, working with the yeast cells and aging. I liked it so much that right after I graduated I applied for a graduate degree in Titorenko’s lab.”\nPart of Dakik’s task is to screen a library of numerous plant extracts in a robust experimental procedure, which allows researchers to identify extracts capable of increasing yeast longevity by delaying aging of yeast cells. The plant extracts Dakik uses are supplied by Idunn Technologies, a scientific research and development company in Rosemère, Que., that specializes in natural health products, especially those associated with aging.\nWith the natural extracts, Dakik begins what is called the screening process aimed at identifying the most efficient aging-delaying natural products. “I start off by testing those numerous plant extracts with the yeast cells and try to see which of them can greatly extend yeast longevity and, thus, delay the aging process,” she explains. “After that, I try to determine the ideal concentration — as with any drug you take there are different concentrations: too high may be toxic, too low might not work.”\nShe then use genetic approaches to assess which pathways are targeted by each of the aging-delaying plant extracts. “I also look into the abilities of certain combinations of these plant extracts to delay aging more efficiently than each of them does individually,” Dakik says. “Once I answer those questions, the other grad students take a more in-depth look at how each of these plant extracts delay aging by impacting various processes in the yeast cell.”\nFor his part, Younes Medkour, BSc (biol.) 15, indulges his love of microscopy and systems biology to determine how and to what extent the yeast cells are affected by each of the aging-delaying plant extracts. “My role is to find what specific processes in various cellular organelles are altered by each of these extracts, and to understand why and how these alterations delay aging,” he says. “I use a combination of experimental approaches to answer these essential questions. These approaches include quantitative mass spectrometry of lipids and proteins, microscopy and bioinformatics.”\nMedkour, who also fast-tracked his studies to begin his PhD in September, had initially intended to study biology as a prelude to medical school yet found himself bitten by the research bug after applying his computer skills in bioinformatics through Selvadurai Dayanandan, a professor in the Department of Biology. Medkour came to Titorenko’s attention when he presented his honours project aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer. This, he says, made it a lot easier for him when he later applied for a graduate research position in Titorenko’s lab.\nOnce there, everything changed for him. “When I saw the research that was going on, I said to myself, ‘This is where I belong, not in med school!’”\nAmanda Piano, BSc (biol.) 14, MSc (biol.) 16, is currently pursuing a certificate in biotechnology at McGill University after completing both her undergrad and graduate degrees while working with yeast cells in Titorenko’s lab. “I was immediately drawn to the research being done in the Titorenko lab and initially joined as a volunteer to explore the prospect of a future in research,” says Piano, who found her passion for biology while a CEGEP student at Dawson College in Montreal.\n“At Dawson, the biology classes were broad and general, but while at Concordia I found myself gravitating towards more specialized work in cell biology,” she recalls. “The intricacy and complexity of the cell and its workings always fascinated me.” Piano claims that Titorenko’s friendliness and dedication to his students combine to play a big role in the research team’s success. “He is devoted and approachable, which makes a great supervisor,” she says.\nCross-country partners\nThe experiments being carried out at Titorenko’s lab are currently focused on yeast; the work on actual cancer cells is being done at research facilities of other institutions by Titorenko’s longstanding colleagues and collaborators — each of whom have been working with lithocholic bile acid and have discovered its effectiveness in not only delaying the aging process but also killing the cells of neuroblastoma, prostate and breast cancers.\nAmong Titorenko’s primary research partners is Andréa C. LeBlanc, a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at McGill, who is a leading researcher at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research at the Jewish General Hospital. LeBlanc’s research with lithocholic acid has led to the discovery that it selectively kills cultured human neuroblastoma cells — a cancer that commonly attacks the adrenal glands.\nAnother collaborator, Troy A.A. Harkness of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, has done extensive research on the treatment of tumours and has worked closely with the Canadian Cancer Society. His experiments with lithocholic acid found that it selectively kills cultured human breast cancer cells as well.\nLikewise, toxicologist Thomas Sanderson, associate professor at the INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier in Laval, Que., heads a research team whose work with lithocholic bile acid has determined that it selectively destroys cultured human prostate cancer cells.\nWhile these discoveries are promising, they are currently restricted to Petri dishes and microscope slides. Titorenko says it will be a while before any of their findings will be applied to human subjects, as a further series of experiments on mice or other animals must first be completed in order to safely determine how their cells react to the lithocholic bile acid.\nTitorenko admits that he and his fellow researchers are sometimes frustrated by the long research process — but at the same time he’s thankful to be working with yeast, as that has sped up the timeline by a considerable margin. “Of course we want to see the results very quickly,” Titorenko says with a smile. “But we must be patient.” \nRelated links\n"}

For millennia, humans have fought the process of aging using everything from fountains of youth to pricey face creams, all to no avail. But a group of Montreal-based researchers is coming ever closer to achieving healthy longevity — armed with the power of science. \nIn a study recently published in Oncotarget , researchers from Concordia University and Idunn Technologies assess how six previously identified plant extracts can delay aging by affecting different signaling pathways that set the pace of growing old.\nVladimir Titorenko\nVladimir Titorenko  is a biology professor and the study’s senior author. He says that the potential of using these plant extracts for delaying the onset of age-related diseases is underscored by the fact that Health Canada classifies them as safe for human consumption. Five of them are recommended by the federal department as health-improving supplements with clinically proven benefits.\nIn the study, Titorenko and his co-authors confirmed that one extract is particularly effective: Salix alba, more commonly known as white willow bark, is the most potent aging-delaying pharmacological intervention yet described.\nTo make this identification, the researchers used yeast to test the effectiveness of the plant extracts. But why yeast? That’s because, at a cellular level, aging progresses similarly in yeast and humans. In both, the pace of aging is defined by a distinct set of chemical reactions arranged into several cascades. These cascades, which scientists call “signalling pathways,” regulate the rate of aging in a wide range of organisms.\nUsing yeast — the best cellular aging model — Titorenko and his colleagues monitored how the information flowing through each of these signalling pathways was affected by  each of the six aging-delaying plant extracts.\n“It’s known that some of these signalling pathways delay aging if activated in response to certain nutrients or hormones,” he says. “These pathways are called ‘anti-aging’ or ‘pro-longevity’ pathways. Other signalling pathways speed up aging if activated in response to certain other nutrients or hormones. These pathways are called ’pro-aging’ or ‘pro-death’ pathways.”\nCo-author Éric Simard, CEO of Idunn Technologies, explains that each of the six aging-delaying plant extracts targets a different anti-aging or pro-aging signalling pathway.\nIt is especially noteworthy that this study revealed the following features of the six plant extracts as potential tools in decelerating chronic symptoms and diseases of old age:\nThey imitate the aging-delaying effects of the caloric restriction diet in yeast\nThey slow yeast aging by eliciting a mild stress response\nThey extend yeast longevity more efficiently than any lifespan-prolonging chemical compound yet described\nThey delay aging through signalling pathways implicated in age-related diseases\nOne of them delays aging via a previously unknown pathway\nThey extend longevity and delay the onset of age-related diseases in organisms other than yeast\n“This study is an important step forward for science because these signaling pathways could eventually  delay the onset and progression of chronic diseases associated with human aging,” says Simard, who has recently published a  new book  on the topic.\n“These diseases include arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, liver dysfunction, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, and many forms of cancer.”\n"}

One way is to change the way we teach.\nThis is exactly what Catherine Calogeropoulos , a part-time instructor in Concordia's Department of Biology , is doing with her “BIOL 203 - Fundamental Nutrition” course. Her challenge? Figuring out a way to make complicated scientific concepts understandable to non-science students. Enter the professional chef.\nTo accompany each lesson, Calogeropoulos shows a video segment of a seasoned cook preparing a meal that supports the concept of the day. “The cooking reinforces the chemistry,” she explains. “It’s easier to understand how lipids work by seeing how mayonnaise is made.”\nBut the course isn’t just about understanding science fundamentals. “It's also about learning vital life skills. I want my students to come away from my course enjoying cooking and knowing how to make healthy, sustainable, inexpensive meals.”\n‘My hope is to stir interest in science’\nChanging the way we teach isn’t just about providing students with alternative ways to digest tough material; it’s also about adapting the way we approach the classroom experience.\nMario D’Amico , a part-time professor in the Department of Physics , teaches “PHYS 298 - Introduction to Astronomy,” a blended course on the foundations of the discipline.\nFor his elective, which attracts students ranging in age from 18 to 80, D’Amico finds the flexibility of the blended approach an advantage. “Attendance to the lecture portion is optional,” he explains. “So those with time or travel constraints can learn most of the course on their computers.”\nThe environment also offers flexibility in the way students can complete their work. “Using online assignments with computer-generated marks and feedback allows them the opportunity to retry questions they get wrong.” This helps those without a science background learn difficult concepts while still keeping their grades up.\nTaking D’Amico’s course is about more than just getting a passing grade to fulfill an elective. “We are at the dawn of space exploration and at the frontiers of scientific innovation,” he says. “My hope is to stir interest in science, physics and astronomy while ensuring that students enjoy a very relaxed experience.”\n \nFor more blended learning opportunities at Concordia, check out Concordia's first ever Massive Open Online Course .\n \n"}

From the white rhino to the blue whale, numbers are dwindling in the face of poaching, habitat destruction and climate change. Although the situation may seem dire, new research gives us reason to hope.\nA study recently published in Evolutionary Applications by a group of Concordia biologists shows that small populations of species can still adapt and respond to natural selection.\n“Our research shows that, just because an animal or plant is few in numbers, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they can’t be brought back from the brink of extinction — they might still possess enough genetic diversity to respond to changing conditions through natural selection,” says biology professor Dylan Fraser , one of the study’s authors.\nBut, he warns, “I wouldn’t advocate that we can hammer down every species. There are a number of concerns always, but from a genetic standpoint, small population size may not be as bad as we initially thought.”\nFor the study, Fraser and his co-authors — Jacquelyn Wood, the senior author who recently graduated from Concordia with her PhD and now works for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry , and current PhD candidate Matthew Yates — combed through empirical studies produced between 1980 and 2014.\nThey produced an extremely thorough database that maps the extent of natural selection and amount of genetic diversity underlying traits needed to adapt to environmental change of 146 separate population groups across 83 different species, ranging from simple plants to large mammals.\n“We found little evidence for consistent differences in genetic variance, or the extent of natural selection across a wide gradient of population size in nature. These are notable results given the large size of the data set and the general lack of research investigating patterns of selection in relation to population size in wild species,” says Fraser.\n“Our results don’t jibe with the widespread view that small populations should have lower amounts of genetic variation. We observed no significant effects of population size on genetic variance in our analysis.” \nThis finding has important implications for conservation efforts, which should consider that the evolutionary trajectories of some small populations appear to be very much affected by natural selection, and different small and large populations of the same species may contain variation that is adaptive in a wide range of circumstances. What’s more, minimum viable population sizes for some species may not need to be as high as previously thought.\nWhile this is cause for hope, Fraser recommends we proceed with cautious optimism.\n“Our findings don’t mean that all species are robust and can handle depletion, but it generally hints that there must be situations in nature that allow small populations to adapt to environmental change. If we can pinpoint which species can handle small population size, and even specific populations within species, it will influence conservation efforts.”\nPartners in research: This study was funded in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council .\n \nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Biology .\n \n"}

It’s great to see Concordia taking steps toward interdisciplinary thinking.”\nLafontaine, who is associate director of ACT, agrees universities could be doing more to promote interdisciplinary dialogue. “We say we work in an interdisciplinary way, but we don’t actually always do the legwork that’s necessary for that to happen.”\nThe first podcast episode, like the first Beyond Disciplines event, looks at the emergence of CRISPR technology , a gene-editing tool that’s been making headlines . Experts who took part came from the Faculty’s Biology , Political Science , Journalism , and Philosophy departments.\n“It was really interesting to see how some of this issue resonated beyond disciples,” says Lafontaine. “For instance, people in Biology were very concerned about the politics of CRISPR, so seeing these common concerns was very enlightening.”\n“I am very proud of our \"Pod Squad\",” says Sawchuk. “Their work is a testament to the amazing talent we have within our Faculty. I hope this podcast will be a way for even more people to hear about the exciting work we have going on across so many disciplines.”\nNow that the first episode has premiered, the Squad is looking forward to audiences hearing the next two episodes.\n“Complex ideas cannot be reduced down to one person’s opinion, or a couple of social media posts,” says Besanger. “We need to be willing to listen to multiple perspectives, draw connections, and think through the messiness. Ultimately, I hope this podcast prompts listeners to consider the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving.”\nLafontaine hopes the audience will embrace the curiosity at heart of the Beyond Disciplines series. “I don’t necessarily hope they come away with answers, but definitely hope they come away with more questions!”\nTo listen to the first episode and read the transcript of the Beyond Disciplines podcast, \"Editing our future with CRISPR\", click here .\nRelated topics\n"}

The stigma can start in school and continue into high school, depending on their teachers’ enthusiasm and their access to resources. That’s why Concordia is involved in several initiatives to dispel this myth by teaching and promoting science to youths through events like summer camps, fairs and tours of Concordia’s labs. The goal is to create an interest in the field, not only for those on a scientific career path, but for any curious student.\nThis fall, Concordia held two events committed to the interactive promotion of science: the Science Summit, held on October 24, and Exposcience, which occurred on November 1-2.\nScience Summit\nThe Science Summit is a new initiative that brought CEGEP students and their teachers to Concordia, where they had the chance to discover what it’s like to research in Concordia’s science labs. They also had the opportunity to conduct guided experiments.\n“For the Science Summit, science should be read broadly, in that we’re looking to provide opportunities in pure and applied, as well as social sciences and other disciplines,” says Bradley Tucker, vice-president of Registrarial Service.\nDue to growing interest from the CEGEP level, the Science Summit is now looking to expand into placements where college students from the Montreal area could gain experience in Concordia’s labs.\n“The initiative aims to introduce college students to Concordia’s state-of-the-art facilities. When it comes time for them to choose a university, they’ll be aware of everything we have to offer,” says Tucker.\nExposcience\nCelebrating its 31st anniversary in November of this year, Exposcience successfully brought together Concordia science students volunteers, young children and their parents. The exhibits and activities are designed to instil in the children an early interest in science and technology. Exposcience also gives Concordia students the chance to positively influence young people while showcasing what they’re learning.\nBehind the event are Miriam Posner and Cameron Tilson, who have both been involved in Exposcience for more than 30 years. They share a passion for teaching kids about science and say the positive feedback they receive is highly rewarding.\n“It makes me proud to be a Concordian,” says Tilson, the assistant director for Institutional Planning. “And it takes me back to my own academic roots in the sciences as a Concordia graduate.”\nTilson shared the story of a Concordia engineering graduate, now in a successful career in aerospace, who remembered coming to Exposcience in the early 1990s. He believes the event played a large part in both his choice of career and university.\nPosner added that Exposcience is family-oriented and that children and their parents engage in learning with Concordia’s student volunteers.\n“One can’t help but be energized by the enthusiasm of our students,” says Posner, the technical supervisor for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, “and by the expressions of fascination in the faces of children as they begin to take in and understand science and technology and see that it can be fun!”\n"}

New research shows that those methods could also be adapted for something with more significant ramifications: the production of drugs including opiates, antibiotics and anti-cancer therapeutics.\nAccording to new studies by researchers from Concordia University in Montreal and the University of California, Berkeley, yeast can be engineered to convert sugar to alkaloids — plant-derived compounds such as codeine and morphine, naturally produced in the opium poppy. \nCollaborating on synthesis\nThanks to research by teams led by Vincent Martin at Concordia and John Dueber at UC Berkeley, the key steps needed to make yeast able to produce alkaloids from inexpensive sugar have been identified.\nIn a new study published in Nature Chemical Biology the researchers were able to synthesize reticuline, a compound from which most alkaloids derive, including the opiates morphine and codeine as well as many other potential new drugs.\n“Getting to reticuline is critical for the process to be economically viable because from there, most of the molecular steps that produce codeine and morphine have been identified in yeast,” says Martin, who is a professor of microbial genomics and engineering at Concordia. “We can explore many different paths to other potential drugs, not just opiates.”\nThe proof is in the yeast\nIn a related study published in PLoS ONE, Martin and his group also engineered yeast for the production of thebaine, a precursor of codeine, morphine and oxycodone, from reticuline. This work further proves that yeast could revolutionize the way complex compounds like alkaloids will be produced in the future.\nDemonstrating that yeast can make valuable known pharmaceuticals is only the beginning. The ultimate goal is to create new complex compounds with therapeutic effects that aren’t naturally produced in high enough volumes to meet demand. \nTogether, these new studies describe the almost complete process of how to make opiates from sugar.\nRed flag for regulators\nPrior to these studies, opiates could only be made from expensive starting molecules, most of which are currently regulated as controlled substances and therefore not readily available without strict permits from governmental agencies.\nMartin and Dueber are conscious of the serious implications of their discovery: it allows for the potential of “home-brewing” opioids. They are calling for regulators and law enforcement officials to pay close attention.\n“We're likely looking at a timeline of a couple of years, not a decade or more, when sugar-fed yeast could reliably produce a controlled substance,\" says Dueber. “We need a common regulatory effort from governments, law officials and the scientific community to prevent misuse and allow the research to continue. The field is moving surprisingly fast and we need to be out in front so that we can mitigate the potential for abuse.”\nPartners in research: Co-authors on the Nature Chemical Biology study are Zachary Russ and Andrew Gonzales from UC Berkeley's Department of Bioengineering and Lauren Narcross from Concordia University's Department of Biology. Co-authors of the PLoS ONE study are Elena Fossati, Lauren Narcross, Andy Ekins and Jean-Pierre Falgueyret from Concordia University's Department of Biology. \n \n"}

Kitney, a professor of biomedical systems engineering at Imperial College London, is central to the United Kingdom's fast-tracked plan to deliver the discipline's benefits to society. As the keynote speaker at Concordia's recent UK-Canada Synthetic Biology Workshop, he explained how British academia, government and companies are working together to harvest scientific advances.\nThe field is moving fast. Synthetic production of the anti-malarial compound artemisinin, naturally found only in the sweet wormwood plant, promises abundant low-cost malaria medication.\nBiosensors developed with synthetic-biology techniques are opening new vistas in detecting and counteracting urinary tract infections, arterial plaque and liver cancer. Vincent Martin of Concordia's Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology is a leader, within the Canadian Cellulosic Biofuels Network, on engineering a yeast strain that can convert plant waste to biofuel.\nNo wonder the World Economic Forum designated synthetic biology, in 2012, as one of 10 \"emerging technologies\" that promise to change the world.\nMore evidence of the field's stature came last week, when Kitney cancelled his trip to Montreal — he addressed the Concordia workshop remotely — because he was summoned to a conflicting meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron.\nKitney said in a Skype interview that the US, UK and China — in that order — are the world's synthetic biology leaders, but there is plenty of room for Canada.\n\"In many ways, Canada is pretty similar to the UK,\" he says. What that country has done to move from theory to practice \"could largely translate to Canada.\"\nIn May 2009, Kitney and a few other British scientists laid out a strategy for \"translation\" of synthetic biology into everyday life. With energetic support from David Willetts, then-minister of state for Universities, Science and Cities, their work grew into a 35-page \"roadmap\" of principles to guide industrial and commercial development.\nAll involved saw the need for strong corporate participation; the roadmap led to a \"leadership council\" of scholars, government officials and corporate executives. The British government named Lionel Clarke, global strategic programme manager of the oil company Shell, to chair a Ministerial Leadership Council on the subject.\nToday, British government funding has fuelled a consortium dispensing seed money. Currently, eight projects are at the proof-of-concept stage, and seven in the development phase.\nFrom the earliest days of planning, Kitney says, everyone involved has foreseen some public resistance to synthetic biology, which some critics see as much more alarming than simple genetically modified organisms. That's why the roadmap emphasizes \"responsible research,\" and why the funding consortium includes social scientists, as well as engineers and biologists.\nKitney is satisfied with the British development model. Canada has its own distinct structures and issues, but he remains optimistic.\n\"I think what we've done could largely translate,” Kitney says. “You might find it's worth having a good look at what we've done.\"\n \n"}

Specifically, they are investigating alternative ways to synthesize drugs like morphine and codeine at Concordia’s Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology.\nFunded by Genome Canada, their research for the PhytoMetaSyn Project aims to develop homegrown medicines that will lessen our dependence on foreign supplies of opium poppies by producing morphine and codeine in Canada. The ultimate goal is to increase the availability of these drugs while driving down cost.\n“Right now, the majority of the opium fields harvested for painkillers consumed in Canada are concentrated in Tasmania, Afghanistan and Turkey,” says research associate Fossati. “Large pharmaceutical companies have a monopoly on these. The ability to tap into opium poppies in a controlled laboratory environment right here at home, and to produce medicines more economically is what we’re striving for.”\nFossati and Narcross are hoping that by using a synthetic biology approach to producing painkillers, they can expand the number of drugs available for testing by pharmaceutical companies. Ideally, the result will be drugs with better or different pharmacological profiles that make the medicines more easily absorbed and potentially less addictive.\nCracking the code\nThe general idea behind this science is to take the genetic machinery (DNA) that results in morphine or codeine from opium poppies, and transfer it to everyday baker’s yeast — the simplest organism that can support it. Microbes, unlike plants, are quick to grow and are not dependent on external factors such as weather and pests.\nThe process is no simple matter.\n“A biochemical pathway is like an assembly line,” says Narcross, a PhD student in biology. “What we’re trying do is to take that assembly line out of opium poppies and put it into yeast. The trouble is, we can’t just ask for the plans. It takes a lot of work to figure out how the plant does what it does.”\nThrough collaboration with colleagues at the University of Calgary, they have a sense of what some of these pathways might look like.\nNarcross explains: “Once we have our own assembly lines set up in yeast, then we can look at how to speed up the process. Which workers are too slow? Is someone trying to do too many things at the same time? Do we need to separate two coworkers who talk too much?”\nAccording to Fossati, creating morphine is just the tip of the iceberg for potential medical uses of synthetic biology. “Poppies don’t just make morphine. They also make hundreds if not thousands of other interesting compounds.”\nSome of these compounds are known pharmaceuticals such as the muscle relaxant papaverine, the probiotic sanguinarine and the antitumor agent noscapine. \nBut what about worries that such a process could fall into the wrong hands — Breaking Bad-style — and lead to the illegal production of heroin?\nNarcross is not concerned. “This process is extremely complex and the tools necessary to produce these medicines are not widely available. Evidently, their production would come under strict regulations and controls.”\n"}

Home to giraffes, elephants, red pandas, mandrills, lemurs and a host of other animals, it will provide students a space to observe wildlife without the added difficulty of tracking them. \nPatrick Paré, biologist at the zoo, is in charge of the department of research and conservation. “In research, our goals are to optimize the organization’s scientific renown and to position it in three sectors of excellence: biodiversity preservation, veterinary medicine research and animal welfare in captivity. With the team of Mr. Weladji, we want to get more knowledge about the impact of enrichment and the exhibit design on animal behaviour, and ultimately on animal welfare.” Paré says.\nRobert Weladji, associate professor in the Department of Biology, has been working with the zoo for five years. Although he has had students spend time researching there in the past, Weladji wanted to formalize an agreement to provide a level of financial and collaborative security.\n“This research should aim at improving knowledge about the animals and how the zoo can improve their conditions,” Weladji says. “The research should be applied enough so there will be a benefit to the zoo, to ensure that it is safe for the zookeepers and safe for the animals.”\nOfficially titled the Concordia-Zoo de Granby Initiative in Ecology, Conservation and Welfare of Captive Wildlife, the five-year partnership is the first of its kind, with both parties reaping rewards.\nThe agreement will open the door for Weladji and his students to collaborate on data collection, research methods and papers with the zoo’s staff. Concordia will also match funds put in by the zoo to help pay for teaching assistants, ensuring that at least four graduate students will receive financial support over the course of the five years.\n“It's something very interesting for me as a researcher and for Concordia as an institution because we are able to offer the students this type of hands-on experience,” Weladji says.\nThe first student selected to take part in this official agreement is Emily Anderson, a master's student in biology. Since July, she has been observing and collecting data on the zoo's Japanese macaques. Of interest to her is the daily behaviour of the monkeys, from grooming to foraging, and how that might change from summer to fall, with a decline in visitors and in the days when the zoo is open to the public.\nThe zoo will also begin constructing a new, larger and more natural habitat for the macaques this fall, and Anderson is looking forward to studying what effect this change will have on them.\n“Because of this, we will be able to compare the behaviour of the same group of individuals in two different habitats, which is relatively uncommon, and we will be able to see if there are changes in their activity budget and whether these changes suggest improved welfare,” she says.\nBut Anderson’s time monitoring the macaques has already led to a few unexpected insights. One such discovery came when local chipmunks began entering the enclosure to steal grains intended as “enrichment” for the primates.\nNaturally, the chipmunks appealed to the macaques as game and were hunted as such, leading Anderson to this conclusion:\n“We joke that the seeds aren't actually the enrichment but the chipmunks are.”\n \n"}

Weladji examines the fallout\nPosted on February 25, 2016\n|\nBy: Rosalyn Roxborough\nIt’s called the  “Cecil effect” and it complicates the moral conversation around big-game hunting in Africa.\nWhen Cecil the lion was killed for sport in Zimbabwe last July by American dentist Walter Palmer, there was a global outcry — after all, Cecil was part of a research program funded by the University of Oxford in England.\n \nThis outrage over Cecil's death sparked a backlash against legal big-game hunting safaris .\nA subsequent fallout of the affair — the so-called \"Cecil effect\" — has been a drop in legal trophy hunting and an overpopulation of lions in Zimbabwe. The Bubye Valley Conservancy, the country's largest wildlife area, may have to cull as many as 200 of the large cats as the cost to relocate even one is prohibitive.\n“People are very sensitive about Cecil’s death, which was tragic, but it’s not so simple,” says Robert B. Weladji , an associate professor in Concordia’s Department of Biology and associate researcher with the Zoo de Granby .\nAs an ecologist concerned with conservation, Weladji must consider how the Cecil effect will impact the ecosystem.\n“If you let the higher trophic level of the food chain — top predators like lions — grow uncontrolled in population, that has a serious effect on the lower trophic levels, the herbivores,” explains Weladji.\n“It can be disastrous in terms of ecosystem functioning. Lions give birth to up to four cubs and have a shorter gestation length, so they reproduce at a faster rate than most herbivores of their size, and they don’t have natural predators. That’s why legal hunting is not always killing for killing’s sake. It’s one way to manage the ecosystem, in this case the Bubye Valley Conservancy.”\nA tourism draught\nFor a relatively poor country like Zimbabwe, Weladji adds, the economic consequences are equally extreme.\nCNBC reported that in 2013, the safari and big-game hunting sector accounted for more than 10 per cent of the country's GDP, with a direct contribution of $71 billion, nearly double the global average on a percentage basis.\nZimbabwe’s tourism professionals sounded the alarm bell as early as July 30, 2015, just a month after Cecil’s death.\n\"Our tourism sector, which was booming, has recorded a significant drop in arrivals in the Hwange National Park, where Cecil was being kept,” Zimbabwe Tourism Authority Chief Executive Karikoga Kaseke told USA Today , without giving exact figures.\n“The culprits have painted Zimbabwe with a dirty brush. We are now seen as people who do not promote and protect animal rights.”\nWeladji is sympathetic to Kaseke and Zimbabwe’s current public relations nightmare, saying that it's important to consider how the hunting revenue was being managed.\n“Ask yourself, ‘Was part of the income from wildlife safaris being reinvested in conservation?’” says Weladji, who cites a February 2016 study in Trends in Ecology & Evolution to that effect.\n“If the money dries up, how will they hire park game wardens, buy cars for anti-poaching units and pay for animal tracking? The whole conservation effort is jeopardized. That’s where the disaster occurs.”\nBut there’s another negative consequence of lion overpopulation that most coverage of the Cecil effect hasn't mentioned.\n“More people and livestock will be killed by lions,” says Weladji. “That’s what happens when there’s no easy access to prey.\n“Local people living near protected areas, as well as their livestock, are easy prey. You can’t let the top predators increase, unchecked, without decimating the herbivores and causing a dysfunctional ecosystem.”\nRead about Concordia professor Robert B. Weladji's  research at the Zoo de Granby .\n \n"}

He’s travelled to South Africa, the Galapagos Islands and Clipperton, a remote island in the Pacific Ocean — all in the name of shark research.\nThomas Leszkiewicz’s photo of a great white shark off of the coast of South Africa.\nFrom an early age, Leszkiewicz had a keen interest in nature and wildlife. While he was born in Montreal, his Polish heritage meant that much of his childhood was spent outdoors.\n“Polish people have an affinity to nature, so my parents really instigated this passion I have,” he says. “From picking mushrooms in the forest with my mom, fishing with my dad and travelling to the ocean as a family with my sister, all of it had a profound impact on me.”\nLeszkiewicz — who learned English by watching children’s TV shows Barney and Mister Rogers — credits Time magazine for spurring his interest in sharks. The publication declared 2011 the “Summer of the Shark” after a high number of attacks and sightings.\n“I vividly remember standing on a pier fishing when a big bull shark appeared. It could have been 20 metres away from swimmers but it was just cruising around not interested in the bathers whatsoever,” he says.\n“That incident made me realize as a young kid that they are not mindless killers, and my interest in them skyrocketed!” “Shortly afterwards someone on the beach yelled, ‘Shark!’ and chaos ensued.”\nDespite those seaside memories with family, choosing to study biology at Concordia was far from an easy decision for Leszkiewicz.\n“I was debating to go into engineering. However, after watching the documentary Sharkwater, I decided to go with my heart and study biology,” he says. “The university helped me a lot. I had amazing and passionate teachers.”\nLeszkiewicz credits two professors in Concordia’s Department of Biology in particular for their support.\n“Bhupinder Mangat had a profound effect on me in my earlier years,” Leszkiewicz says. “We took the same train, so I got to chat a lot with him one on one! It was sad hearing of his passing.” Mangat died in 2012.\n“The other is Dylan Fraser. His classes were always intriguing and made my last year the best. He ended up writing a letter of recommendation for my internship in South Africa,” Leszkiewicz says.\nLeszkiewicz with a Giant Manta Ray off Clipperton Island, near Mexico. | Photo: Jenni Whiteley Photography\nLeszkiewicz’s 2012 Galapagos Islands trip was organized through the Concordia Biology Students Association. While on the island, he cut down invasive plant species and planted coffee beans — low profile work, he says, that fuelled his love for the Great Whites.\n“Visiting those islands is a must for any biology enthusiast,” Leszkiewicz says.\nHe also saw Lonesome George, the last known giant tortoise from Pinta Island. At the time, George was considered the world’s rarest animal because of his age — 102 years — and the fact that he was too shy to reproduce.\n“Poor guy died a couple weeks later in his sleep, so we were really lucky,” he says. “There is much to say about the Galapagos Islands, a true paradise unlike any other.”\nIn 2014, he spent two months as an intern for the South Africa-based Oceans Campus, helping a group of doctoral students in their research efforts. During the expedition, Leszkiewicz was a diver-of-all-trades, doing everything from filling water with bait to luring sharks with tuna heads to spotting sharks from the top of the boat.\n“Working out in the ocean each day on a boat surrounded by white sharks is definitely an unforgettable experience,” Leszkiewicz says. “We had one scary moment where a female white shark torpedoed towards a tuna head we were using as bait and slammed into our boat.”\nMore recently in Clipperton, Leszkiewicz had a hands-on role — literally. As part of a team of scientists, and researchers, he was given the task of attaching sensory tags to the sharks for researchers to track their movements and behaviours.\nThe trip was partially funded by Leszkiewicz’s current employer, Sherwood Scuba in Montreal, where he works as a sales representative for the scuba diving products company.\nTrue to his European roots, Leszkiewicz suited up for the Concordia Stingers men’s soccer team for the 2008-09 season. “I’m as passionate of soccer as I am of sharks, so it was a privilege to represent my school with varsity sports,” he says.\nKnee injuries ended his varsity sports career yet have not hampered his passion for marine discovery. Now back in Montreal, Leszkiewicz recently embarked on another shark-filled adventure — this one a bit more under wraps.\nWhat is it? “I cannot speak about it much,” he said just before he left. “As soon as I can, I will let you know!”\n#CUalumni\n"}

That’s why we went into science,” he says.\nBiot-Pelletier and Vallerand are both working on yeast-related projects in Vincent Martin ’s lab. Martin is the Concordia University Research Chair in Microbial Engineering and Synthetic Biology.\nVallerand is working on engineering yeast to use methanol as an energy source, while Biot-Pelletier is looking at identifying more sustainable sources of sugar for yeast to feed on rather than food crops,\nSoftware for solving problems\nBoth students began teaching themselves how to code in order to more rapidly advance their work. Relying on software and equation libraries has limited impact, Biot-Pelletier says: “Sometimes you need to solve a problem that no one before you has solved, in which case you’ll need to write your own software.”\nThat’s where Python for Scientific Concordians comes in.\nThe workshop series begins May 16 with guest lecturer Darren Platt , head of data science at American biotechnology firm Amyris, who will shed light on why computers and biology make good bedfellows.\nA natural programmer who kept computer science as a backup plan in case biology didn’t work out, Platt says he didn’t have the patience for academia and lab work. “I really like building things that people use, and I can point to the impact,” he says.\nAmyris makes malaria medication , industrial lubricants, renewable jet fuel and materials used in cosmetics — namely squalene, historically cultivated from shark livers and now a plant-derived, biodegradable ingredient. “Anything nature can make you can make in yeast if you engineer it,” Platt says.\nEngineered yeast holds a lot of biomedical and biotechnological promise, but it requires intensive computing, Platt says — first, to design the desired yeast, and then to test it and collect resulting data. This is where Platt, who is also a trained biologist, shines.\nStrong interest so far\nIf registrations are a marker of interest, the seven-week workshop is bound to make waves: More than 100 people have already registered, which is free thanks to funding from the Concordia School of Graduate Studies . Platt’s introductory lecture — which is open to the public — will help set the context and make the case for computational biology. The subsequent weekly sessions will be taught by different professors from Concordia, McGill and Génome Québec.\n“I hope that with this workshop and the fact that we’ve had 100 subscriptions in 10 days, the university realizes this is something people are interested in and hopefully it can become a program in the future for students to take,” Vallerand says.\n \nDarren Platt’s lecture, “The Future of Computation in Biology,” on May 16 from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE-110) on Loyola Campus, is free and open to the public.

Can Christopher Plenzich’s research video win NSERC's national award?", "text": "Graduate student Christopher Plenzich is in the running for NSERC's Science, Action! video prize\nPosted on March 14, 2016\n|\nBy: Tom Peacock\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\nChristopher Plenzich, a master’s student in Biology, recently submitted a video to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Science Action! Video Contest .\nThe one-minute film, called En Masse, shows forest tent caterpillars on the hunt for food. Plenzich is encouraging people to watch it because the 15 submissions with the most views will make it to the final round. The winners of Science Action! will be determined by a panel of judges.\nWe asked Plenzich about how he became interested in his chosen research topic.\n‘The caterpillars began to grow on me.’\nChristopher Plenzich: It all began three years ago when I was looking for a master's supervisor. I contacted Emma Despland and met with her. I was offered a position to work with these caterpillars.\nAdmittedly, I was completely lost when I began my research. I had just finished my undergrad in environmental sciences and was looking for a change, and I did not have much training in biology.\nIt took some time, but after spending every day alone with the caterpillars, they began to grow on me. Fast-forward to three years later, and I've almost completed my master's with them, and had a very successful art exhibit in collaboration with Alison Reiko Loader.\nWas your decision to enter the contest inspired by your collaboration?\nCP: Yes it was! The footage I used for the video entry came from what I shot with Alison Reiko Loader for our En Masse exhibit. I thought it was just another interesting and different way to portray my master's research. The footage was shot in collaboration with Alison.\nWhere are you at right now with your research? \nCP: I'm finishing up. I actually hope to submit my thesis by the end of the week and schedule a defense date!\nIn the video, you conclude that your findings could have positive implications for forest managers. Can you elaborate?\nThe forest tent caterpillar is an outbreaking species. This means that at times, their population can be really low, and at other times, their population peaks in forests, which can cause damage to trees because the caterpillars must constantly eat to sustain their transformation into a moth (since they can't eat as a moth because they emerge with a non-functional mouth).\nThe mechanisms that cause an outbreak are complex, so the more we know about the caterpillar behaviour, the better we can predict and mitigate any negative effects they cause.\nWhat my research found is that when these caterpillars are eating leaves that are not optimally nutritious, they would rather leave the safety of their colony and venture out and perhaps find better quality food, but risk encountering a predator.\nAlso, social caterpillars, like the forest tent caterpillar, make great models to study group behaviour because they are easily manageable and there has been quite a bit of research done on them.\nSo, by extrapolating the findings from these caterpillars to other larger animals, we can get a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how animals groups are formed and how they disperse.\nFind out more about the Department of Biology .\n \nThumbnail by Greg Hume via Wikimedia Commons.\n \n"}

Adrian Tsang, a professor in Concordia’s Department of Biology and director of the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics, certainly hopes they’ll have a role to play.\nHe is researching how woody biomass — everything from agricultural straw to tree branches — might be converted to monomeric sugars. These sugars, in turn, may serve as the basis for things like biofuels, plastics and chemicals that will offer a sustainable alternative to products we rely on each day.\n“That conversion can happen through enzyme hydrolysis,” Tsang says. “We’re exploring how to do it in an efficient, cost-effective way.”\nFrom June 2 to 4, the centre is holding the 5th Annual General Meeting of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada’s (NSERC) Bioconversion Network. The conference — which is expected to draw almost 80 researchers and students from across the country — includes a series of workshops led by experts from the University of Wisconsin, BP Biofuels and the Dutch biotechnology research centre DSM, among others.\n“We’re bringing these leading researchers here to look at what, from their perspective, are the kinds of advances being made and, also, in future, where the new advances will come from,” Tsang says.\nThus far, these advances have arrived in the form of new enzymes found largely in fungi and bacteria. Through those enzymes, these micro-organisms are able to break down — or hydrolyze — wood and other materials, and use their sugars to feed themselves. The key for humans, Tsang says, will be to learn to do the same.\n“We’re working to identify the different combinations of enzymes they use, and we’re trying to use these cocktails ourselves to hydrolyze woody biomass efficiently.”\nWill our vehicles one day run on fuel fashioned from monomeric sugars? Though it’s possible now, according to Tsang, it will take decades for petroleum to be replaced completely. For the time being, he and his colleagues are focused on drawing these resources from seemingly unlikely sources.\n“We’re not going to stop using energy,” Tsang says. “We’re not going to stop driving cars. The question, really, is whether we can make everything we do a little more environmentally friendly.”\nThe 5th Annual General Meeting of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada’s (NSERC) Bioconversion Network takes place from June 2 through 4 in the Research Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE) Building on the Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.).\n \n"}

MacArthur. After an appointment at Tufts University, he joined Concordia’s Department of Biology in 1975 as assistant professor and was promoted to professor in 1987. He was active in ecological research throughout his career and taught a wide range of courses in ecology and organismal biology. He selflessly shared his passion for science with his numerous graduate students as a Fellow of the Science College, through his regular contributions and participation in the Pointe-Claire science fair, by organizing the aquatic ecology exhibit (annually since 1984), and through his many CEGEP site visits.\nCalla lillies by Marilynn Taylor (Flickr Creative Commons)\nMaly played an important role in the life of the department, serving as graduate program director, associate chair and chair, and as the mentor for the ecology research group. “My colleagues and I in the Department of Biology are truly saddened by Ed’s passing,” says Patrick Gulick, chair of the Department of Biology. “Ed was with the department for more than three decades and taught many of the students who completed degrees in biology during his tenure. He was a dedicated and inspirational professor and colleague who will be sorely missed.”\n \n"}

That’s a good thing since Guerrieri, who is graduating with a specialization in women’s studies, aspires to work in the humanitarian field — though she’s not sure yet in what exact capacity.\n“I would need to be front line, to see and feel any changes,” says Guerrieri. “Because of the focus of my activist work, I see myself working primarily with women, queer communities or youth.”\nSince moving to Montreal three years ago to attend Concordia, Guerrieri has served on the Tribunal Hearing Pool in Concordia’s Office of Student Tribunals, heard cases involving Academic Code of Conduct charges and volunteered with the Social Justice Committee of Montreal, an independent human rights organization. At the same time, she’s maintained grades that have kept her on the Dean’s List.\n“The biggest thing I will take from my experience at Concordia, from my activities and studies, is meeting so many different people who have inspired me to think differently,” Guerrieri says. “By being active in different fields, I was able to keep my mind open to different points of view.”\nShe plans to continue with graduate studies at some point. But for now, the Italian-born social activist wants to focus on improving her French: Guerrieri intends to apply to stay in Quebec through the Programme de l’expérience québécoise.\nVolunteer par excellence\nWhile her professors enriched her academic knowledge, Sophie Kräuchi credits her fellow students with inspiring her during her undergraduate years.\n“Concordia’s dynamic institution stems from the passions of its students and this is what has really helped me to flourish,” says the new BA with Honours in Sociology graduate.\nKräuchi, who will continue with master’s studies in international development in her Swiss hometown’s University of Geneva, only got involved in student life after her first year left her feeling there was more to university than attending class and doing homework.\nTwo events then unleashed her potential. The first was an invitation to join Concordia’s chapter of the Golden Key International Honour Society, which led to her serving on the executive team. The second event was a trip to Ecuador with United to Benefit Ecuadorian Children, International, an organization that helps children and youth build a better future for themselves.\n“I came to understand, in the famous words of anthropologist Margaret Mead, ‘that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world,’ ” Kräuchi writes in an email.\nSince then, she has been involved with the Casa Cares annual charity fashion show, the Sociology and Anthropology Students’ Association, Humanitarian Awareness Concordia University, and in developing the Concordia chapter of World University Service of Canada.\nHer efforts were recognized in April with Concordia’s Arts and Science Federation of Associations’ Outstanding Contribution to Student Life Award.\n“Finding equilibrium between studies, work and socializing is tough, but adding the volunteering aspect was key,” says Kräuchi. “Giving back doesn’t need to be time-consuming or expensive. It just needs to be meaningful.”\nBeing in the moment\nSevan Mattie recalls the most important moment of his time at Concordia. It happened during an English course in his first term, when the professor told the class to notice things actively. For Mattie, this concentrated focus allowed him to question more deeply.\n“That advice changed how I learned,” says Mattie, a native of Iraq who is graduating with a BSc with Honours in Biology — and two articles published in scientific journals, Yeast and Aging.\nParticularly interested in how we grow older, he’s been researching mitochondria and its role in the aging process. He received an undergraduate research award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada as well as a training award from the Fonds de recherche en santé du Quebec, among others, to help advance his studies.\nHe’s also a member of the Concordia Science College and, with a 4.22 GPA, of the Golden Key International Honour Society.\nAt Concordia, Mattie has been particularly impressed by the level of interaction between students and professors, calling this “one of the qualities at which Concordia excels. You’re not lost in an ocean of students.”\nThis fall, Mattie, who also volunteers at the Jewish General Hospital’s pathology department, will begin his master’s in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University. After that, he’s considering pursuing either a PhD or possibly a double medical-philosophical doctorate.\nHis experience at Concordia will serve him well into this future. “I learned how to deal with stress, how to interact with others, how to study; it wasn’t all academic.”\nRelated links:\n"}

No, better: it’s real life.\nFive Concordia students are finding faster, cheaper and more accurate ways to test biological samples for drugs and poison.\nBiochemistry Co-op students Vincent Grenier, Maxime Gosselin, Greg Kozadjian and Kevin Louie — as well as chemistry honours student Brigitte Desharnais — have been making a real difference at Quebec’s main forensics lab, Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de médecine légale in Montreal.\nIn the past few years they found a better way to identify GHB, the “date rape” drug; spot minute amounts of cyanide; and detect signature compounds that indicate a natural death from undiagnosed diabetes.\n“The analyses we make and the conclusions we draw are what a judge and jury will eventually consider,” says Maxime Gosselin. “We provide clues that are often indispensable to exposing the truth.” Gosselin adds that at the lab, he “used world-class equipment to test for controlled substances like cocaine, amphetamines, street drugs and some of the most powerful poisons known to man.”\nGreg Kozadjian’s Co-op term involved developing a method called the 3G, which screens for about 320 prescribed and illicit drugs using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) testing. “With LC-MS, there is no need for modification steps, therefore guaranteeing lower analysis costs and improving confidence in results,” he says. “Inaccurate drug testing results can suggest innocence when the answer should be guilt.”\nBut these important advances are only part of what this partnership has accomplished. Vincent Grenier’s GBH research was published in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology; he’ll be pursuing his PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, this fall, and hopes to work as a researcher in the biotech-pharma sector afterwards.\nBrigitte Desharnais’ method for detecting small amounts of cyanide in different biological samples, including blood and gastric contents, led to publication in Forensic Science International. Desharnais, a PhD student and the recipient of a $50,000-a-year Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Vanier Scholarship, is now leading her own project at the forensics lab.\nMore than anything, a Co-op work term is an opportunity for students to learn from professionals. Kevin Louie worked closely with a supervisor to develop a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method to determine if an individual’s death could be the result of undiagnosed diabetes. This can play a role in ruling out other suspected unnatural causes of death, such as poison.\n“It is extraordinary when you realize that you work for such an amazing organization, and that your work will help in some measure to continue its excellent tradition of supporting justice,” says Louie.\nGosselin agrees. “At the crime lab, I was introduced to professions I hadn’t considered pursuing. I saw pathologists and forensic toxicologists at work, and developed a keen interest in both careers. There’s no saying where I’ll go in the years to come, but it’s great to know that there are so many possibilities out there.”\nThe appreciation goes both ways. As supervisor Martine Lamarche, a chemist and forensic toxicologist, says, “The students from Concordia are a bonus to our current technical and scientific team. We are very thankful for their help.”\nRelated links:\n"}

Muthukumaran Packirisamy, a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, recently used his lab-on-a-chip technology for a collaborative study with colleagues at l’Université de Montréal. The aim was to find out what conditions are optimal for a plant’s pollen tube to release sperm.\n“The huge value of lab-on-a-chip technology is that you can create a controlled environment to study things on a nano level,” explains Packirisamy. “It can be used to study blood cells, neurons, or — as in this case — plant sperm.”\nPackirisamy and his colleagues, including lead collaborator, Anja Geitmann at UdeM, were able to design a lab-on-a-chip in which the plant cell was forced to squeeze through tiny apertures made of material softer than the plant’s cell wall. Controlling the growth and direction of the cell while also using such surrounding structures as sensors made it possible to estimate the pressure inside the cell. This gave the researcher the ability to learn what pressures were optimal for sperm release.\nThis recent study is the latest example of how Concordia engineers contribute to the life sciences. Much of this work is conducted at the Optical-Bio Microsystems Laboratory, which Packirisamy directs. The technology developed here is a prime example of what has been called the “Third Revolution” in the life sciences, a phrase coined by Nobel Laureate Phillip Sharp to describe the interdisciplinary collaboration of engineers, physicists and biologists.\nPackirisamy’s research in this area, called micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), integrates micro-fluidics with micro-photonics and nano features. In layman’s terms, this is the science of designing, manufacturing, and formulating devices and processes that deal with miniscule volumes of fluid, combined with directing and manipulating light on a microscopic scale.\nHolding the position of Concordia Research Chair on Optical-Bio Microsystems, Packirisamy also leads research in the area of BioMEMS, an application of micro-nanotechnologies in biology. He co-authored the book Bio-MEMS: Science and Engineering Perspectives, published in 2011 by CRC Press. This is an authoritative and comprehensive exploration of this new field of inquiry.\nThis study, called “Quantification of Cellular Penetrative Forces Using Lab-on-a-chip Technology and Finite Element Modeling,” was co-authored by Amir Sanati Nezhad, Mahsa Naghavi, Muthukumaran Packirisamy, Rama Bhat and Anja Geitmann, was published in the proceedings of the national Academy of Sciences and funded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec — Nature et technologies.\nRelated links:\n"}

Indeed, it has been said that the ability to slow the ageing process would be the most important medical discovery in the modern era.\nA new study published in the journal Oncotarget by researchers from Concordia and the Quebec-based biotech company Idunn Technologies may have uncovered an important factor: plant extracts containing the six best groups of anti-ageing molecules ever seen.\nFor the study, the research team combed through Idunn Technologies’ extensive biological library, conducting more than 10,000 trials to screen for plant extracts that would increase the chronological lifespan of yeast.\nWhy yeast? Cellularly speaking, ageing progresses similarly in both yeast and humans. It’s the best cellular model to understand how the anti-ageing process takes place.\n“In total, we found six new groups of molecules that decelerate the chronological ageing of yeast,” says Vladimir Titorenko , the study’s senior author and a professor in the Department of Biology at Concordia.\nHe carried out the study with a group of Concordia students and Éric Simard, the founder of Idunn Technologies, which is named for the goddess of rejuvenation in Norse mythology.\nThis has important implications not only for slowing the ageing process, but also for preventing certain diseases associated with ageing, including cancer.\n“Rather than focus on curing the individual disease, interventions on the molecular processes of ageing can simultaneously delay the onset and progression of most age-related disorders,” says Simard, who notes that these new molecules will soon be available in commercial products.\n“This kind of intervention is predicted to have a much larger effect on healthy ageing and life expectancy than can be attained by treating individual diseases.\"\n“These results also provide new insights into mechanisms through which chemicals extracted from certain plants can slow biological ageing,” says Titorenko.\nAn extract of willow bark has shown to be one of the most potent longevity-extending pharmacological interventions yet described in scientific literature.\nOne of these groups of molecules is the most potent longevity-extending pharmacological intervention yet described in scientific literature: a specific extract of  willow bark .\nWillow bark was commonly used during the time of Hippocrates, when people were advised to chew on it to relieve pain and fever. The study showed that it increases the average and maximum chronological lifespan of yeast by 475 per cent and 369 per cent, respectively. This represents a much greater effect than rapamycin and metformin, the two best drugs known for their anti-ageing effects.\n“These six extracts have been recognized as non-toxic by Health Canada, and already exhibit recognized health benefits in humans,” says Simard.\n“But first, more research must be done. That’s why Idunn Technologies is collaborating with four other universities for six research programs, to go beyond yeast, and work with an animal model of ageing, as well as two cancer models.”\nPartners in research: This study was supported in part by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies, the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship Award, the Concordia University Chair Fund and the Concordia University Undergraduate Research Award.\nThe co-authors of this study are Vicky Lutchman, Younes Medkour, Eugenie Samson, Anthony Arlia-Ciommo, Pamela Dakik, Berly Cortes, Rachel Feldman, Sadaf Mohtashami, Mélissa McAuley, Marisa Chancharoen, Belise Rukundo and Vladimir I.

Concordia biology professor Alisa Piekny shares her thoughts on a scientific scandal\nPosted on January 29, 2016\n|\nBy: Alisa Piekny\nRecently the science world has been buzzing about a controversy involving the new  genome-editing technology CRISPR . The fuss began when Eric Lander , a biology professor at MIT , penned an article for prominent science publication Cell on the history of CRISPR's discovery.\nThe article, \" The Heroes of CRISPR ,\" neglected to mention Lander is involved in a CRISPR-related patent lawsuit with two other scientists, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, who played a major role in CRISPR's development. Not only did fellow scientists question Lander's (and Cell's) lack of disclosure, but Lander was also accused of trying to write women out of CRISPR's history.\nAlisa Piekny , an associate professor in Concordia's  Department of Biology , is participating in the February 10 conference  Beyond Disciplines: Editing genes? The Science and Ethics of the New Biotechnology . We asked her to explain the outrage surrounding this scientific breakthrough.\n \nThe strange case of the missing 'heroines of CRISPR'\nWhat was your reaction when you heard about this controversy?\nAlisa Piekny: I wasn't surprised, due to the competitive nature of research — recognition, funding, publishing. Especially in a time when advances in technology and rapid communication mean that many scientists (with the means) can quickly identify and advance 'novel' areas of research. Who made a 'discovery or important advancements' becomes murky.\nSome scientists may fight to be properly recognized for their contributions, since this recognition can open the door to more patent and funding opportunities, which is crucial at a time when funding is tight in most countries. Unfortunately, those that fight the hardest also often care more about prizes and money than they do about advancing science.\nBut the recognition for important contributions to, and the advancement of, CRISPR goes even deeper than this, because it also highlights the fact that many women are often overlooked for their contributions to science. This is a problem that has occurred for decades, if not hundreds of years. \nTo be clear, the article does discuss the women involved in the history of CRISPR, but it may have glossed over the importance of their contribution and according to statements made by one of the woman involved (Doudna), may not have been entirely factually correct.\nWhat do you think this says about the prevalence of sexism in STEM disciplines?\nAP: I think gender bias is an ongoing problem in science and technology — the older generation is especially male-dominant and some, or many, may not have open bias per se, but simply favour their 'colleagues and friends', many of whom happen to be male (and white).\nI think the problem boils down to competition. People can be fiercely competitive at a time when access to funding is limited and those that are most vocal or visible often win out over those that aren't. Also, it may not be instinctive for most women to do this. \nIs this something you’ve observed in your own career, or experienced yourself? \nAP: I see this all the time in my field. The men are more successful at getting external funding, they seem to have an easier time getting papers accepted, especially in high tier journals, and they seem to be better networked in terms of collaborations and working with the private sector.\nOf course, this is circular. Some would argue that they have the better grants and opportunities because they have the better publications. But the bottom line is that many women are often disadvantaged. Further, they are often still the primary caregivers and as soon as they have a family, this restricts the time that they can dedicate to their research.\nThe agencies are getting better at recognizing this, but the fierce competition for funding is closing the door for many women in science, because it is harder for them to compete with their male peers. Publishing is also something that has become a real issue in my field, but this isn't necessarily restricted to gender — this may apply to any junior researcher.\nWhat used to be acceptable for publication as an article in a strong mid-to-high tier journal would only be considered as a 'communication or report' nowadays. And the review process doesn't always work and may not be fair. Most journals still use a blind approach, where the authors do not know the reviewers, but the reviewers know the authors. This allows the reviewers to hide behind their anonymity and they have no accountability.\nI have seen many reviews, personally, that are simply not professional or that demand unrealistic changes before a manuscript can be accepted. Some of us may not have the resources, but more importantly, would these changes actually impact the outcome of the 'story' or are they simply demanded because they are 'sexier?'\nAgain, I go back to the 'old boys club,' where publishing has become a game of who knows who, and where friends review each other’s papers.\nI am not saying that excellent science isn't published in good journals, but there likely are lots of excellent research articles that are not getting published or are not getting into better journals simply because of one reviewer that blocked it.\nMy previous supervisor used to say that 'good science will be recognized regardless of where it is published,' but I disagree. We are bombarded with more and more online journals, some of which may have questionable review practices (or no peer review), and most of us don't have the time to even consider these articles.\nWhat have you been observing about the reaction to this story, from both male and female scientists?\nAP: There are many male colleagues who are very aware that gender bias exists, which is why they brought attention to this article in the first place. Many of these men may have worked under or with women during their careers, or have wives who are active scientists. \nMichael Eisen at Berkeley  wrote an interesting piece  on the article by Lander in Cell on the discovery of CRISPR. It is very witty, and pokes fun at Lander. At the same time, though, it brings up some interesting issues regarding patenting and intellectual property, and Nobel prizes or other awards recognizing a few scientists for what was likely a coordinated effort by many scientists.\nHe highlights how the tone Lander uses to describe the history of CRISPR leading up to work done by Zhang (the scientist currently in a patent dispute from his own Institute), changes as soon as he starts discussing the work done by Zhang. (He figured out how to use the technology to efficiently edit mammalian genomes). It is clear that Lander is pushing Zhang as the key person who pushed CRISPR into the limelight. \nWhat do you think needs to change in order for things to improve?\nThere are many male colleagues who are very aware that the bias exists, which is why they brought attention to this article in the first place. Eisen is an example.\nAs more men and women are less tolerant and call out their colleagues and peers for especially blatant bias, then this should change with time. Those at the top have more onus than those at the bottom. For example, editors and panel review members for granting agencies need to become more aware and perhaps disregard reviews coming from those with potential conflicts of interest.\nI think what bothers me the most is that Cell, which is a top journal in my field, published an opinion piece by someone who has an obvious conflict of interest on the topic (Lander is the director of the Broad Institute, which is in a patent dispute on CRISPR). For me, this brings into question the ethics of the journal itself and makes you wonder how many articles were rejected or not considered on subjective bias because reviews were carried out by those with conflicts of interest.\nYou will be participating in a panel discussion on CRISPR and the new biotechnology on February 10. Do you think this issue will be raised? \nAP: I am not sure how aware the general public is about this latest scandal, but gender bias would be a great topic to discuss with the panel. It gets to the deeper issue of gender bias in STEM in general , and how women struggle for recognition in male-dominant fields. It will be interesting to see how the patent disputes play out, and the role of policy, another interesting topic that will be discussed by the panel. \n \n"}

While the symptoms are relatively mild, medical researchers have recently linked it to the birth defect microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and to suffer from brain damage.\nIn Brazil in 2014, there were only 147 cases of microcephaly. Last year, as the virus spread, that number jumped to 2,782 cases. Health officials there are advising women not to get pregnant.\nJean-Philippe Lessard is an assistant professor in Concordia’s Department of Biology . He runs the Community Ecology and Biogeography Lab . We asked him to provide some information about why the decades-old virus has suddenly become the scourge of the New World.\nZika’s trans-Atlantic voyage\nThe Zika virus was not recorded in South or North America until recently, and its arrival was probably due to transfer by humans. \nWithin the mosquito genus Aedes you have several species, some of which are unique to Africa, some of which are unique to South America and some of which are found everywhere. It seems like this virus is able to switch from one species to the other as long as they’re within that genus.\nThe species of mosquito that carry the virus are found in tropical environments all over the world — the main one being Aedes aegypti, which is found in Africa, but also India, South-east Asia, South and Central America, and also a little bit in the south-eastern United States. That seems to be the main vector. \nEradication efforts are underway in urban areas to reduce the chance of exposure to humans, and it's worked out in the past. You won't eradicate these mosquitoes, because they're everywhere, but if you reduce their density, you reduce the chance of them transmitting the disease.\nThe evolutionary arms race\nThe main problem is that when you bring a new virus into a new place, humans' immune systems are not adapted to it, and the virus takes advantage of this. You get big outbreaks because of that. Eventually, the human body will adapt to it and learn to fight it off.\nIn Africa, there's likely a higher rate or proportion of people who are immune. That's what evolutionary theory would say, at least. They're engaged in what we call an arms race, where the virus tries to become stronger and the human body tries to respond to it.\nThey've been engaged in that race for about 50 years in Africa, and so there’s some kind of equilibrium that has been reached there. In South America, it's a new phenomenon, so it might take a while before we see that happen. \n﻿Will it spread to North America?\nPeople are ﻿worried because incidences of the disease are being reported further north, closer to the United States. But if you look at other similar, neotropical viruses like Dengue or Yellow Fever, even though they're carried by the same type of mosquito, the occurrence of these diseases is relatively rare in the United States. This suggests that some kind of climactic barrier exists that prevents the virus from doing well in temperate climates.\nIt's not enough just to have the mosquito; you also need to have the right climate for the virus to do well. \nThe other thing is that, right now the virus is contained within one species of mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and that species is not widespread in the US. If it switches to other species of mosquito, then it could become more problematic.\nThis evolutionary switch has not happened yet, and even if it does happen, as it happened with yellow fever and dengue already, it still doesn't mean that the virus will be able to tolerate winter and the drier conditions that we have.\nI think a lot of things need to happen before it becomes a tangible threat in North America. Some scientists have built models trying to predict zones that would be suitable for the Zika Virus. They show that Florida could be a high-risk area.\nBut if you look at other neotropical viruses transmitted by the same mosquitoes, you would also predict finding them in the Eastern United States and especially Florida, which is kind of tropical. But you still don't find them.\nObviously, this particular virus could follow a different evolutionary path and evolve very, very quickly to adapt to both a new mosquito and new climactic conditions. But again, it's unlikely based on what we know.\nFind out more about Concordia’s Department of Biology .\n \n"}

But for Concordia’s  Faculty of Arts and Science,  crossing traditional academic lines is exactly the goal.\nBeyond Disciplines, a new series of public events, brings together a variety of researchers to discuss a challenging issue.\n“I wanted to showcase the interdisciplinary nature of our Faculty, which I think is one of our greatest strengths,” says Dean  André Roy .\n“Very few universities in Canada have a faculty like ours, which crosses so many disciplines, from the natural sciences to the social sciences to the humanities,” he says. “That is what makes us so lucky, and that’s what the Beyond Disciplines events are going to highlight.”\nKim Sawchuk , associate dean of Research and Graduate Studies, agrees. “We need dialogues on timely topics in our society to tackle the problems and challenges that need to be addressed through different perspectives, methods and approaches,” she says.\n“We have an incredible talent pool of engaged, committed and curious researchers to draw upon, who want to meet each other and engage in these conversations for the common good.”\nPlaying with DNA\nThe first event, Editing Genes? The Science and Ethics of the New Biotechnology, will take place on Wednesday, February 10.\nConcordia experts will discuss a new tool called  CRISPR , or \"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,\" that’s made it easier than ever to edit DNA.\nNeedless to say, CRISPR technology is not without controversy, much of which focuses on its potential for abuse.\n“This technology could move quickly from the lab to the community, and people should think about it before it does,” says  Paul Joyce , associate dean of Academic Programs, and a professor in the  Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry  who has been working with Sawchuk to organize the event.\n“Legislation may have to follow,” he adds.\nDavid Secko , an associate professor from the  Department of Journalism , will host the talk.\n“I hope we can help drive discussion on how ethics and science can interface over how CRISPR is used,” he says “I’m very excited to see what our diverse faculty can bring to this event.”\nFrancesca Scala , an associate professor from the Department of Political Science , says she’s interested in the benefits and challenges of engaging citizens around such topics.\n“One of my research areas is science and technology policy and the politics of expertise that often shape who does or does not have a say in the governance of science,” she says. “At the panel, I’ll be talking about why and how citizens can participate in the debate on CRISPR.”\nOne important topic that’s bound to come up during the conversation is the  recent scandal  in the scientific community surrounding whether a team of female scientists is being denied credit for their role in creating CRISPR.\n“I think gender bias is an ongoing problem in science and technology,” says  Alisa Piekny , associate professor in the  Department of Biology , who will be participating in the event. “The older generation is especially male dominant and some, or many, may not have open biases per se, but simply favour their colleagues and friends, many of whom happen to be male — and white.”\nBut Piekny is hopeful change will come to the field. “As more men and women are less tolerant and call out their colleagues, especially for blatant bias, then this could change with time.”\nStorytelling, diversity and online learning\nBeyond Disciplines is set to grow over the months to come. A March event is planned on how storytelling and narrative can be integral to research in a variety of disciplines.\n“Storytelling is important in so many ways — I don’t see it in opposition to factual knowledge,” says Sawchuk.\n“I would argue that numbers and data tell a kind of story, as they need interpretation. How, in the faculty, can we understand what constitutes a fact, or evidence, from different disciplinary perspectives?”\nOther events in the works include a spring research showcase on the theme of diversity, and a fall discussion on Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs.\nHealthy arguments\n“We are embracing experimentation and imperfection with Beyond Disciplines,” says Roy, adding that the series will allow the faculty to embody the spirit of Concordia’s strategic directions.\n“These events are absolutely in line with the Faculty’s and university’s goals,” says Roy. “They will allow our faculty to  experiment boldly , to  mix it up , and of course to  get our hands dirty ! But, most of all, they will allow us to  go beyond .”\nWhile Sawchuk acknowledges the Faculty’s experts may not always be in agreement on the topics at hand, she says that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n“Argumentation and disagreement can be healthy if we do it well in our Faculty, and learn how to discuss and debate beyond our disciplines,” she says. “What a beautiful challenge for us as a Faculty!”\n \nThe first Beyond Disciplines event takes place on Wednesday, February 10, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics in Room GE-110, on Concordia’s Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.).\nThe event is free and open to the public.

Bats also help with crops: they act as a natural pesticide by feeding on harmful insects.\nBut these winged mammals are now under threat. As agricultural intensification expands across the world, the conversion of their natural habitats has caused a dramatic decline in population. North American bats are also plagued with white-nose syndrome, an emerging infectious disease that’s decimating their numbers.\n“Many bat populations in Quebec have lost 80 to 100 per cent in recent years,” says Concordia biology professor Jean-Philippe Lessard. \nWith this in mind, researchers from Concordia and the University of Tennessee studied the importance of different types of habitats for insectivorous bats living in and around agricultural regions.\nIn a paper recently published in the journal Biological Conservation, a team including Lessard and led by graduate student Noa Davidai showed that protecting natural habitats in systems that are highly modified by humans could help struggling bat populations.\n“Our key result indicates that within an intensive agricultural landscape, the proportion of natural habitat is very important for the bats,” says Davidai, who conducted the study while pursuing graduate research at the University of Tennessee. “More natural habitat means increased bat activity, and possibly healthier populations.”\nThe researchers analyzed 9,552 hours of recordings of bat calls captured over 243 nights, from 15 separate monitoring sites in an intensively farmed region of south-central Texas. They used bat detectors and insect pheromone traps to monitor nightly bat activity, as well as the abundance of the corn earworm moth — a tasty treat for bats and also one of the world’s most destructive crop pests.\nWhile heavily farmed areas do provide bats with an enormous supply of moths to prey on, the supply varies greatly throughout the growing season. When crops are not flowering and ripening, they no longer provide a sufficient insect source: natural habitats become crucial for maintaining the bat populations.\nThese findings have economic as well as ecological implications. It’s estimated that the pest-control provided by the bats is worth well over $741,000 per year in Texas alone. And by reducing the use of pesticides in the environment, this ultimately delays the need for new pesticides.\nLessard, one of the study’s co-authors, notes that these results resonate for bat populations across North America. The 80 to 100 per cent declines seen in Quebec are, he says, due in large part to white-nose syndrome, but “the destruction of their habitats is another major problem.”\nHe adds that this is something we can all help prevent. “One thing we can do is to make sure to preserve the habitats bats need to survive. This means preserving natural patches of habitat in areas where much of the natural forest has been cut for agricultural purposes, such as in the region of Montérégie, near Montreal.”\nLessard also encourages residents to help protect bats by participating in batwatch.ca , an online initiative developed by the Government of Quebec, the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science and researchers at several universities.\n“We’re asking the citizens across Quebec and Ontario to help us locate bat colonies they might encounter in nature or around their homes,” says Lessard. “This information is crucial, as it allows us to evaluate the status of bat populations and develop a plan of action for conservation.”\n \nFind out more about biology research at Concordia . \n \n"}

Home to giraffes, elephants, red pandas, mandrills, lemurs and a host of other animals, it will provide students a space to observe wildlife without the added difficulty of tracking them. \nPatrick Paré, biologist at the zoo, is in charge of the department of research and conservation. “In research, our goals are to optimize the organization’s scientific renown and to position it in three sectors of excellence: biodiversity preservation, veterinary medicine research and animal welfare in captivity. With the team of Mr. Weladji, we want to get more knowledge about the impact of enrichment and the exhibit design on animal behaviour, and ultimately on animal welfare.” Paré says.\nRobert Weladji, associate professor in the Department of Biology, has been working with the zoo for five years. Although he has had students spend time researching there in the past, Weladji wanted to formalize an agreement to provide a level of financial and collaborative security.\n“This research should aim at improving knowledge about the animals and how the zoo can improve their conditions,” Weladji says. “The research should be applied enough so there will be a benefit to the zoo, to ensure that it is safe for the zookeepers and safe for the animals.”\nOfficially titled the Concordia-Zoo de Granby Initiative in Ecology, Conservation and Welfare of Captive Wildlife, the five-year partnership is the first of its kind, with both parties reaping rewards.\nThe agreement will open the door for Weladji and his students to collaborate on data collection, research methods and papers with the zoo’s staff. Concordia will also match funds put in by the zoo to help pay for teaching assistants, ensuring that at least four graduate students will receive financial support over the course of the five years.\n“It's something very interesting for me as a researcher and for Concordia as an institution because we are able to offer the students this type of hands-on experience,” Weladji says.\nThe first student selected to take part in this official agreement is Emily Anderson, a master's student in biology. Since July, she has been observing and collecting data on the zoo's Japanese macaques. Of interest to her is the daily behaviour of the monkeys, from grooming to foraging, and how that might change from summer to fall, with a decline in visitors and in the days when the zoo is open to the public.\nThe zoo will also begin constructing a new, larger and more natural habitat for the macaques this fall, and Anderson is looking forward to studying what effect this change will have on them.\n“Because of this, we will be able to compare the behaviour of the same group of individuals in two different habitats, which is relatively uncommon, and we will be able to see if there are changes in their activity budget and whether these changes suggest improved welfare,” she says.\nBut Anderson’s time monitoring the macaques has already led to a few unexpected insights. One such discovery came when local chipmunks began entering the enclosure to steal grains intended as “enrichment” for the primates.\nNaturally, the chipmunks appealed to the macaques as game and were hunted as such, leading Anderson to this conclusion:\n“We joke that the seeds aren't actually the enrichment but the chipmunks are.”\n \n"}

The stigma can start in school and continue into high school, depending on their teachers’ enthusiasm and their access to resources. That’s why Concordia is involved in several initiatives to dispel this myth by teaching and promoting science to youths through events like summer camps, fairs and tours of Concordia’s labs. The goal is to create an interest in the field, not only for those on a scientific career path, but for any curious student.\nThis fall, Concordia held two events committed to the interactive promotion of science: the Science Summit, held on October 24, and Exposcience, which occurred on November 1-2.\nScience Summit\nThe Science Summit is a new initiative that brought CEGEP students and their teachers to Concordia, where they had the chance to discover what it’s like to research in Concordia’s science labs. They also had the opportunity to conduct guided experiments.\n“For the Science Summit, science should be read broadly, in that we’re looking to provide opportunities in pure and applied, as well as social sciences and other disciplines,” says Bradley Tucker, vice-president of Registrarial Service.\nDue to growing interest from the CEGEP level, the Science Summit is now looking to expand into placements where college students from the Montreal area could gain experience in Concordia’s labs.\n“The initiative aims to introduce college students to Concordia’s state-of-the-art facilities. When it comes time for them to choose a university, they’ll be aware of everything we have to offer,” says Tucker.\nExposcience\nCelebrating its 31st anniversary in November of this year, Exposcience successfully brought together Concordia science students volunteers, young children and their parents. The exhibits and activities are designed to instil in the children an early interest in science and technology. Exposcience also gives Concordia students the chance to positively influence young people while showcasing what they’re learning.\nBehind the event are Miriam Posner and Cameron Tilson, who have both been involved in Exposcience for more than 30 years. They share a passion for teaching kids about science and say the positive feedback they receive is highly rewarding.\n“It makes me proud to be a Concordian,” says Tilson, the assistant director for Institutional Planning. “And it takes me back to my own academic roots in the sciences as a Concordia graduate.”\nTilson shared the story of a Concordia engineering graduate, now in a successful career in aerospace, who remembered coming to Exposcience in the early 1990s. He believes the event played a large part in both his choice of career and university.\nPosner added that Exposcience is family-oriented and that children and their parents engage in learning with Concordia’s student volunteers.\n“One can’t help but be energized by the enthusiasm of our students,” says Posner, the technical supervisor for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, “and by the expressions of fascination in the faces of children as they begin to take in and understand science and technology and see that it can be fun!”\n"}

New research shows that those methods could also be adapted for something with more significant ramifications: the production of drugs including opiates, antibiotics and anti-cancer therapeutics.\nAccording to new studies by researchers from Concordia University in Montreal and the University of California, Berkeley, yeast can be engineered to convert sugar to alkaloids — plant-derived compounds such as codeine and morphine, naturally produced in the opium poppy. \nCollaborating on synthesis\nThanks to research by teams led by Vincent Martin at Concordia and John Dueber at UC Berkeley, the key steps needed to make yeast able to produce alkaloids from inexpensive sugar have been identified.\nIn a new study published in Nature Chemical Biology the researchers were able to synthesize reticuline, a compound from which most alkaloids derive, including the opiates morphine and codeine as well as many other potential new drugs.\n“Getting to reticuline is critical for the process to be economically viable because from there, most of the molecular steps that produce codeine and morphine have been identified in yeast,” says Martin, who is a professor of microbial genomics and engineering at Concordia. “We can explore many different paths to other potential drugs, not just opiates.”\nThe proof is in the yeast\nIn a related study published in PLoS ONE, Martin and his group also engineered yeast for the production of thebaine, a precursor of codeine, morphine and oxycodone, from reticuline. This work further proves that yeast could revolutionize the way complex compounds like alkaloids will be produced in the future.\nDemonstrating that yeast can make valuable known pharmaceuticals is only the beginning. The ultimate goal is to create new complex compounds with therapeutic effects that aren’t naturally produced in high enough volumes to meet demand. \nTogether, these new studies describe the almost complete process of how to make opiates from sugar.\nRed flag for regulators\nPrior to these studies, opiates could only be made from expensive starting molecules, most of which are currently regulated as controlled substances and therefore not readily available without strict permits from governmental agencies.\nMartin and Dueber are conscious of the serious implications of their discovery: it allows for the potential of “home-brewing” opioids. They are calling for regulators and law enforcement officials to pay close attention.\n“We're likely looking at a timeline of a couple of years, not a decade or more, when sugar-fed yeast could reliably produce a controlled substance,\" says Dueber. “We need a common regulatory effort from governments, law officials and the scientific community to prevent misuse and allow the research to continue. The field is moving surprisingly fast and we need to be out in front so that we can mitigate the potential for abuse.”\nPartners in research: Co-authors on the Nature Chemical Biology study are Zachary Russ and Andrew Gonzales from UC Berkeley's Department of Bioengineering and Lauren Narcross from Concordia University's Department of Biology.

Specifically, they are investigating alternative ways to synthesize drugs like morphine and codeine at Concordia’s Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology.\nFunded by Genome Canada, their research for the PhytoMetaSyn Project aims to develop homegrown medicines that will lessen our dependence on foreign supplies of opium poppies by producing morphine and codeine in Canada. The ultimate goal is to increase the availability of these drugs while driving down cost.\n“Right now, the majority of the opium fields harvested for painkillers consumed in Canada are concentrated in Tasmania, Afghanistan and Turkey,” says research associate Fossati. “Large pharmaceutical companies have a monopoly on these. The ability to tap into opium poppies in a controlled laboratory environment right here at home, and to produce medicines more economically is what we’re striving for.”\nFossati and Narcross are hoping that by using a synthetic biology approach to producing painkillers, they can expand the number of drugs available for testing by pharmaceutical companies. Ideally, the result will be drugs with better or different pharmacological profiles that make the medicines more easily absorbed and potentially less addictive.\nCracking the code\nThe general idea behind this science is to take the genetic machinery (DNA) that results in morphine or codeine from opium poppies, and transfer it to everyday baker’s yeast — the simplest organism that can support it. Microbes, unlike plants, are quick to grow and are not dependent on external factors such as weather and pests.\nThe process is no simple matter.\n“A biochemical pathway is like an assembly line,” says Narcross, a PhD student in biology. “What we’re trying do is to take that assembly line out of opium poppies and put it into yeast. The trouble is, we can’t just ask for the plans. It takes a lot of work to figure out how the plant does what it does.”\nThrough collaboration with colleagues at the University of Calgary, they have a sense of what some of these pathways might look like.\nNarcross explains: “Once we have our own assembly lines set up in yeast, then we can look at how to speed up the process. Which workers are too slow? Is someone trying to do too many things at the same time? Do we need to separate two coworkers who talk too much?”\nAccording to Fossati, creating morphine is just the tip of the iceberg for potential medical uses of synthetic biology. “Poppies don’t just make morphine. They also make hundreds if not thousands of other interesting compounds.”\nSome of these compounds are known pharmaceuticals such as the muscle relaxant papaverine, the probiotic sanguinarine and the antitumor agent noscapine. \nBut what about worries that such a process could fall into the wrong hands — Breaking Bad-style — and lead to the illegal production of heroin?\nNarcross is not concerned. “This process is extremely complex and the tools necessary to produce these medicines are not widely available. Evidently, their production would come under strict regulations and controls.”\n"}

Kitney, a professor of biomedical systems engineering at Imperial College London, is central to the United Kingdom's fast-tracked plan to deliver the discipline's benefits to society. As the keynote speaker at Concordia's recent UK-Canada Synthetic Biology Workshop, he explained how British academia, government and companies are working together to harvest scientific advances.\nThe field is moving fast. Synthetic production of the anti-malarial compound artemisinin, naturally found only in the sweet wormwood plant, promises abundant low-cost malaria medication.\nBiosensors developed with synthetic-biology techniques are opening new vistas in detecting and counteracting urinary tract infections, arterial plaque and liver cancer. Vincent Martin of Concordia's Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology is a leader, within the Canadian Cellulosic Biofuels Network, on engineering a yeast strain that can convert plant waste to biofuel.\nNo wonder the World Economic Forum designated synthetic biology, in 2012, as one of 10 \"emerging technologies\" that promise to change the world.\nMore evidence of the field's stature came last week, when Kitney cancelled his trip to Montreal — he addressed the Concordia workshop remotely — because he was summoned to a conflicting meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron.\nKitney said in a Skype interview that the US, UK and China — in that order — are the world's synthetic biology leaders, but there is plenty of room for Canada.\n\"In many ways, Canada is pretty similar to the UK,\" he says. What that country has done to move from theory to practice \"could largely translate to Canada.\"\nIn May 2009, Kitney and a few other British scientists laid out a strategy for \"translation\" of synthetic biology into everyday life. With energetic support from David Willetts, then-minister of state for Universities, Science and Cities, their work grew into a 35-page \"roadmap\" of principles to guide industrial and commercial development.\nAll involved saw the need for strong corporate participation; the roadmap led to a \"leadership council\" of scholars, government officials and corporate executives. The British government named Lionel Clarke, global strategic programme manager of the oil company Shell, to chair a Ministerial Leadership Council on the subject.\nToday, British government funding has fuelled a consortium dispensing seed money. Currently, eight projects are at the proof-of-concept stage, and seven in the development phase.\nFrom the earliest days of planning, Kitney says, everyone involved has foreseen some public resistance to synthetic biology, which some critics see as much more alarming than simple genetically modified organisms. That's why the roadmap emphasizes \"responsible research,\" and why the funding consortium includes social scientists, as well as engineers and biologists.\nKitney is satisfied with the British development model. Canada has its own distinct structures and issues, but he remains optimistic.\n\"I think what we've done could largely translate,” Kitney says. “You might find it's worth having a good look at what we've done.\"\n \n"}

Adrian Tsang, a professor in Concordia’s Department of Biology and director of the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics, certainly hopes they’ll have a role to play.\nHe is researching how woody biomass — everything from agricultural straw to tree branches — might be converted to monomeric sugars. These sugars, in turn, may serve as the basis for things like biofuels, plastics and chemicals that will offer a sustainable alternative to products we rely on each day.\n“That conversion can happen through enzyme hydrolysis,” Tsang says. “We’re exploring how to do it in an efficient, cost-effective way.”\nFrom June 2 to 4, the centre is holding the 5th Annual General Meeting of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada’s (NSERC) Bioconversion Network. The conference — which is expected to draw almost 80 researchers and students from across the country — includes a series of workshops led by experts from the University of Wisconsin, BP Biofuels and the Dutch biotechnology research centre DSM, among others.\n“We’re bringing these leading researchers here to look at what, from their perspective, are the kinds of advances being made and, also, in future, where the new advances will come from,” Tsang says.\nThus far, these advances have arrived in the form of new enzymes found largely in fungi and bacteria. Through those enzymes, these micro-organisms are able to break down — or hydrolyze — wood and other materials, and use their sugars to feed themselves. The key for humans, Tsang says, will be to learn to do the same.\n“We’re working to identify the different combinations of enzymes they use, and we’re trying to use these cocktails ourselves to hydrolyze woody biomass efficiently.”\nWill our vehicles one day run on fuel fashioned from monomeric sugars? Though it’s possible now, according to Tsang, it will take decades for petroleum to be replaced completely. For the time being, he and his colleagues are focused on drawing these resources from seemingly unlikely sources.\n“We’re not going to stop using energy,” Tsang says. “We’re not going to stop driving cars. The question, really, is whether we can make everything we do a little more environmentally friendly.”\nThe 5th Annual General Meeting of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada’s (NSERC) Bioconversion Network takes place from June 2 through 4 in the Research Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE) Building on the Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.).\n \n"}

No, better: it’s real life.\nFive Concordia students are finding faster, cheaper and more accurate ways to test biological samples for drugs and poison.\nBiochemistry Co-op students Vincent Grenier, Maxime Gosselin, Greg Kozadjian and Kevin Louie — as well as chemistry honours student Brigitte Desharnais — have been making a real difference at Quebec’s main forensics lab, Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de médecine légale in Montreal.\nIn the past few years they found a better way to identify GHB, the “date rape” drug; spot minute amounts of cyanide; and detect signature compounds that indicate a natural death from undiagnosed diabetes.\n“The analyses we make and the conclusions we draw are what a judge and jury will eventually consider,” says Maxime Gosselin. “We provide clues that are often indispensable to exposing the truth.” Gosselin adds that at the lab, he “used world-class equipment to test for controlled substances like cocaine, amphetamines, street drugs and some of the most powerful poisons known to man.”\nGreg Kozadjian’s Co-op term involved developing a method called the 3G, which screens for about 320 prescribed and illicit drugs using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) testing. “With LC-MS, there is no need for modification steps, therefore guaranteeing lower analysis costs and improving confidence in results,” he says. “Inaccurate drug testing results can suggest innocence when the answer should be guilt.”\nBut these important advances are only part of what this partnership has accomplished. Vincent Grenier’s GBH research was published in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology; he’ll be pursuing his PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, this fall, and hopes to work as a researcher in the biotech-pharma sector afterwards.\nBrigitte Desharnais’ method for detecting small amounts of cyanide in different biological samples, including blood and gastric contents, led to publication in Forensic Science International. Desharnais, a PhD student and the recipient of a $50,000-a-year Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Vanier Scholarship, is now leading her own project at the forensics lab.\nMore than anything, a Co-op work term is an opportunity for students to learn from professionals. Kevin Louie worked closely with a supervisor to develop a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method to determine if an individual’s death could be the result of undiagnosed diabetes. This can play a role in ruling out other suspected unnatural causes of death, such as poison.\n“It is extraordinary when you realize that you work for such an amazing organization, and that your work will help in some measure to continue its excellent tradition of supporting justice,” says Louie.\nGosselin agrees. “At the crime lab, I was introduced to professions I hadn’t considered pursuing. I saw pathologists and forensic toxicologists at work, and developed a keen interest in both careers. There’s no saying where I’ll go in the years to come, but it’s great to know that there are so many possibilities out there.”\nThe appreciation goes both ways. As supervisor Martine Lamarche, a chemist and forensic toxicologist, says, “The students from Concordia are a bonus to our current technical and scientific team. We are very thankful for their help.”\nRelated links:\n"}

Muthukumaran Packirisamy, a professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, recently used his lab-on-a-chip technology for a collaborative study with colleagues at l’Université de Montréal. The aim was to find out what conditions are optimal for a plant’s pollen tube to release sperm.\n“The huge value of lab-on-a-chip technology is that you can create a controlled environment to study things on a nano level,” explains Packirisamy. “It can be used to study blood cells, neurons, or — as in this case — plant sperm.”\nPackirisamy and his colleagues, including lead collaborator, Anja Geitmann at UdeM, were able to design a lab-on-a-chip in which the plant cell was forced to squeeze through tiny apertures made of material softer than the plant’s cell wall. Controlling the growth and direction of the cell while also using such surrounding structures as sensors made it possible to estimate the pressure inside the cell. This gave the researcher the ability to learn what pressures were optimal for sperm release.\nThis recent study is the latest example of how Concordia engineers contribute to the life sciences. Much of this work is conducted at the Optical-Bio Microsystems Laboratory, which Packirisamy directs. The technology developed here is a prime example of what has been called the “Third Revolution” in the life sciences, a phrase coined by Nobel Laureate Phillip Sharp to describe the interdisciplinary collaboration of engineers, physicists and biologists.\nPackirisamy’s research in this area, called micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), integrates micro-fluidics with micro-photonics and nano features. In layman’s terms, this is the science of designing, manufacturing, and formulating devices and processes that deal with miniscule volumes of fluid, combined with directing and manipulating light on a microscopic scale.\nHolding the position of Concordia Research Chair on Optical-Bio Microsystems, Packirisamy also leads research in the area of BioMEMS, an application of micro-nanotechnologies in biology. He co-authored the book Bio-MEMS: Science and Engineering Perspectives, published in 2011 by CRC Press. This is an authoritative and comprehensive exploration of this new field of inquiry.\nThis study, called “Quantification of Cellular Penetrative Forces Using Lab-on-a-chip Technology and Finite Element Modeling,” was co-authored by Amir Sanati Nezhad, Mahsa Naghavi, Muthukumaran Packirisamy, Rama Bhat and Anja Geitmann, was published in the proceedings of the national Academy of Sciences and funded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec — Nature et technologies.\nRelated links:\n"}

That’s a good thing since Guerrieri, who is graduating with a specialization in women’s studies, aspires to work in the humanitarian field — though she’s not sure yet in what exact capacity.\n“I would need to be front line, to see and feel any changes,” says Guerrieri. “Because of the focus of my activist work, I see myself working primarily with women, queer communities or youth.”\nSince moving to Montreal three years ago to attend Concordia, Guerrieri has served on the Tribunal Hearing Pool in Concordia’s Office of Student Tribunals, heard cases involving Academic Code of Conduct charges and volunteered with the Social Justice Committee of Montreal, an independent human rights organization. At the same time, she’s maintained grades that have kept her on the Dean’s List.\n“The biggest thing I will take from my experience at Concordia, from my activities and studies, is meeting so many different people who have inspired me to think differently,” Guerrieri says. “By being active in different fields, I was able to keep my mind open to different points of view.”\nShe plans to continue with graduate studies at some point. But for now, the Italian-born social activist wants to focus on improving her French: Guerrieri intends to apply to stay in Quebec through the Programme de l’expérience québécoise.\nVolunteer par excellence\nWhile her professors enriched her academic knowledge, Sophie Kräuchi credits her fellow students with inspiring her during her undergraduate years.\n“Concordia’s dynamic institution stems from the passions of its students and this is what has really helped me to flourish,” says the new BA with Honours in Sociology graduate.\nKräuchi, who will continue with master’s studies in international development in her Swiss hometown’s University of Geneva, only got involved in student life after her first year left her feeling there was more to university than attending class and doing homework.\nTwo events then unleashed her potential. The first was an invitation to join Concordia’s chapter of the Golden Key International Honour Society, which led to her serving on the executive team. The second event was a trip to Ecuador with United to Benefit Ecuadorian Children, International, an organization that helps children and youth build a better future for themselves.\n“I came to understand, in the famous words of anthropologist Margaret Mead, ‘that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world,’ ” Kräuchi writes in an email.\nSince then, she has been involved with the Casa Cares annual charity fashion show, the Sociology and Anthropology Students’ Association, Humanitarian Awareness Concordia University, and in developing the Concordia chapter of World University Service of Canada.\nHer efforts were recognized in April with Concordia’s Arts and Science Federation of Associations’ Outstanding Contribution to Student Life Award.\n“Finding equilibrium between studies, work and socializing is tough, but adding the volunteering aspect was key,” says Kräuchi. “Giving back doesn’t need to be time-consuming or expensive. It just needs to be meaningful.”\nBeing in the moment\nSevan Mattie recalls the most important moment of his time at Concordia. It happened during an English course in his first term, when the professor told the class to notice things actively. For Mattie, this concentrated focus allowed him to question more deeply.\n“That advice changed how I learned,” says Mattie, a native of Iraq who is graduating with a BSc with Honours in Biology — and two articles published in scientific journals, Yeast and Aging.\nParticularly interested in how we grow older, he’s been researching mitochondria and its role in the aging process. He received an undergraduate research award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada as well as a training award from the Fonds de recherche en santé du Quebec, among others, to help advance his studies.\nHe’s also a member of the Concordia Science College and, with a 4.22 GPA, of the Golden Key International Honour Society.\nAt Concordia, Mattie has been particularly impressed by the level of interaction between students and professors, calling this “one of the qualities at which Concordia excels. You’re not lost in an ocean of students.”\nThis fall, Mattie, who also volunteers at the Jewish General Hospital’s pathology department, will begin his master’s in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University. After that, he’s considering pursuing either a PhD or possibly a double medical-philosophical doctorate.\nHis experience at Concordia will serve him well into this future. “I learned how to deal with stress, how to interact with others, how to study; it wasn’t all academic.”\nRelated links:\n"}
