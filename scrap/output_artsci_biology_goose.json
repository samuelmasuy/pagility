It defines academic programs and the regulations that pertain to them. The University Senate reserves the right to modify the academic programs and regulations at its discretion after the posting date of the Calendar. In addition, the University reserves the right to modify the posted scale of tuition and other student fees and to limit the number of students who enrol in any program or course at any time before the beginning of an academic term. Moreover, the information contained in the Undergraduate Calendar or any other University document related to academic programs, deadlines, and regulations is subject to verification and correction by the Office of the Registrar and the School of Graduate Studies.\n\n \n\n Not all courses listed in this Calendar are offered this year. Students are advised to consult the Undergraduate Class Schedule for a timetable of courses offered.\n\n \n\n Please note that the Undergraduate Calendar is available solely online and constitutes \n\n the official Undergraduate Calendar of the University. The most recent version of the Calendar is the only version currently in effect. Students are responsible for ensuring that graduation requirements are met, in accordance with the requirements set out in the Calendar corresponding to the year of admission, except for Engineering programs. Students in the Engineering programs are required to graduate having met the substantial equivalent of the curriculum in force in the winter term prior to degree conferral. Archived Calendars may be consulted using the “Archived Calendars” link.\n\n \n\n This Calendar is intended to assist readers to understand the academic and administrative structure and policies and procedures of the University, and to describe the academic programs offered. The material has been submitted by academic units and administrative departments. Every effort has been made to ensure that all general information and course references are accurate as of the date of posting, but these are subject to possible verification and correction. By the act of registration each student becomes bound by the policies and regulations of Concordia University, including the Faculty in which the student is registered. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the general information, rules and regulations contained in the Calendar, and with the specific information, rules and regulations of the Faculty or Faculties in which they are registered or enrolled or seek registration or enrolment, as well as the specific requirements of each degree or certificate sought. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the courses chosen are appropriate to the program requirements.\n\n \n\n Concordia University disclaims all responsibility and liability for loss or damage suffered or incurred by any student or other party as a result of delays in or termination of its services, courses, or classes by reason of force majeure, including fire, flood, riots, war, strikes, lock-outs, damage to University property, financial exigency and/or other events beyond the reasonable control of the University.

Refer to Step 3A – Browse Course Catalog.\n\nOnce you have decided on the courses you would like to take, please go to Step 3B – Search for Classes where you can now start to fill your Course Cart with classes for each term.\n\nPlease note the following:\n\nYou will not be allowed to register for courses where any of the class hours (including labs, tutorials, etc.) overlap with another course. It is important to be prepared in advance with several different schedules and a list of replacement courses in case your original choices are not available.\n\nIf you plan on registering for English Composition or ESL (English as a Second Language) courses and have written the appropriate placement test, your results will be sent to you by e-mail.\n\nYou should consult the Graduate Calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ‘requisites not met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the Graduate Calendar. If you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department so that they can look into this matter for you.\n\nDegree students: You are not permitted to register for a course that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you have received authorization from an academic adviser to register for a course without the stated prerequisite, the adviser must enter a waiver that will permit you access to the course.\n\nQualifying programs: Qualifying program courses consist of deficiencies and/or additional course requirements that are not part of the degree program requirements. These courses can be undergraduate or graduate level. All qualifying courses are to be completed in the first 3 terms following your term of admission. If you are in graduate program with qualifying course requirements, these courses must be taken beginning with the first term of your program.\n\nIndependent/Visiting students: If you wish to register for courses where the prerequisite was not completed at Concordia, you must contact the relevant Graduate Program Assistant to receive permission.\n\nSome classes have seats that are reserved for students in specific programs. This is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program are able to register for it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats to be reserved.  If you try to register for a class and receive a message about ‘reserved seats’ then you should select another class or consult the department to obtain permission to take the class.\n\nSome classes may require that you first obtain permission to take the class. If you receive a message that states: “Department Consent Required”, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class in order to obtain permission to register."}
