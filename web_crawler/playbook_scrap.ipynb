       "u'Undergraduate programs Undergraduate programs Get inspired by the rich diversity of the living world & rapid advances in the study of biology. At a glance Our BSc program offers many options. Students planning a career or graduate studies in the biological sciences are encouraged to follow an Honours or Specialization program. The Honours programs require a strong academic performance and a two-term undergraduate research project and thesis as a 6-credit course (BIOL 490). The Major and Minor programs have fewer required credits in the biology curriculum and allow students to take more courses in other disciplines to acquire their BSc degree. The Major includes all courses that are required for admission to most medical degree programs. Our programs are known for... More faculty per student For every 25 undergraduate students there is one professor. \\xa0 Smaller classes Our class sizes range from 10 to 170 students. Dedicated and professional faculty Our\\xa0 \\xa0are enthusiastic and passionate in their teaching and are readily accessible for discussion with students.
